            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Moon was not as yet worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Eaſt, neither yet had the Empire of <hi>Aſia</hi> received command from the Tyranny of one alone, where in an Iſland of the <hi>Carpatian</hi> Sea a gallant Galley came to ſhore; It was furniſhed with all thoſe Ornaments that could render Majeſty and Strength. To eſcape the Anger of Heaven, which with building Mountaines of waves threatned Precipices to thoſe within, it was retired into this Iſland: where between two mighty Rocks that made a Creeke it promiſed it ſelf all ſecurity. The Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers having caſt Anchors, made a ladder, and ſuddenly there was ſeene to come forth of it a moſt beautifull Lady, which tormented (I know not whether more) by the incommodities of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169974:6"/>Sea, or the paſſions of the heart, could hardly be ſuſtained by the arme of a Knight that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her. Her Majeſty and Apparell ſhewed her of great birth; The honour that was done to her by all made her known to be Lady of them all. Teares and ſighs did not prejudice that Beauty, which being infinite could not be ſubject to the accidents of ſorrow. The Knight, not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by the confuſed noiſe of thoſe in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, led her aſide into a Thicket of Trees, where it appeared that Nature had emulated, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone it ſelfe; Here ſending back thoſe who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, accompanying and interrupting his words with their complaints, he thus began to entreat her: How long (Princeſſe) ſhall the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of your diſdaine continue? How long will you keep that hate which renders you incapable of my affections? That which I can pretend to, by the right of War, by the merit of juſtice, by the obligement of correſpondency, I would find it in your gift, and I beſeech it as a grace; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, diſdaine not that heart which ſo much the more deſerves affection, becauſe it ſeeks that by favour which is its own by juſtice. If at other times you have refuſed me, becauſe I was your vaſſall, you cannot now do ſo, being become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to me. Accommodate the greatneſſe of your mind to the encounters of a new Fortune, for I pretend to no more but your Love; you ought to comfort your ſelfe, that among ſo many loſt you have gained one to make you, not only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you a Queene. I will not ſay I love you,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169974:6"/>becauſe with women that ordinarily cannot love, or do not credit it, an enamoured heart finds no recompence. Paſt things may be deſired, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Teares and afflictions never open Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, or make the dead riſe. There is no griefe that can move pity in the Deſtinies; You have to an exceſſe ſatisfied the Obligations you owed to nature, you are now engaged to pay thoſe of Intereſt, and Reaſon. Any patience but a Lovers (ſuch as I am) would have been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into fury. I hope to diſſwade you from your obſtinacy, becauſe I cannot perſwade my ſelfe that you had rather fall into the precipices of my diſdaine, than exalt your ſelfe over the affection of my heart. The Princeſſe, full of the ſence of paſſion and diſdaine, not able longer to endure theſe words, that wounded her ſoule, replied thus.</p>
            <p>I would not anſwer you (Duke) the words of a Traitour, deſerving none: But that you may perceive your hopes deſperate in my reſolutions, I proteſt before all the Deities of Heaven, that rather then be thine I would encounter death a thouſand times. Treacherous man, haſt thou pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted thy hands with the bloud of thy Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do's yet thoſe maſſacred unburied bodies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame to heaven thy diſloyalty, and attempts thee to poſſeſſe me! I complaine of nature, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me a woman hath denied me the uſe of weapons to chaſtiſe thy perfidiouſneſſe; but yet I aſſure my ſelfe, that the Juſtice of the Gods will not leave unpuniſhed ſo execrable a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169974:7"/>I hope to ſee thee (Traitour) betrayed by thy ſelfe, to fall in thy own Treacheries; She proceeded, but he interrupting her ſaid, Princeſſe I have not affection for her that deſpiſes me; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I love where I am hated; you may well enough vent the injuſtices of your paſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring me; wrong not my hands to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my heart, neither urge me to a neceſſity to correct the errours of your tongue. I feare (thou wicked man) replied the Princeſſe, thy love much more than thy hatred. Thy furies have no power over the Decree of Heaven, which hath rendred thee a ſlave to me. In theſe treacheries of thine I triumph over thy perfidiouſneſſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I bewaile me of thy cruelty, traytours being alwaies ſo. Affection could no longer keep the fomentations of Anger within the Dukes breaſt, being ſo much the more inſupportable by reaſon they ſtrooke home to his Conſcience; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience offended by juſt reproofs hath no bridle that can curbe it. He ſhewed by the paleneſſe of his Face, the lightning of his eyes, with the ſtriking of his hands, that love and diſdaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in his heart. He was ready to ruſh into ſome exceſſe of revenge, when he was ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome confuſed voices, which being loſt among the multitude of thoſe Trees, ſtrooke his eares with an unknown murmur. The remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the place he was in afforded him not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to diſcerne from whence they came. His Imagination being tranſported upon variety of things, not knowing what to perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169974:7"/>or reſolve, he perceived one of his Knights, who much troubled ran to ſeeke him. Scarce could the Duke aske the novelty of this noiſe, but he underſtood his Galley was aſſaulted by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and in danger to be loſt without his help. He would heare no more, but committing the care of the Princeſſe to that Knight, ran with all ſpeed to their reliefe.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe at this recovered ſpirit, hoping they were her Subjects comming to fight for her and redeeme her; when ſhe underſtood that for a certaine they were Pyrates, ſhe conſulted with <hi>Celardo</hi> (for ſo the Knight was named) to ſecure her ſelfe from the tyranny of the Duke, or the cruelty of the Pyrates; The hands of both of them execrable and dangerous. They ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to walke towards the top of ſome little Mount to ſearch for a place of refuge. They were ſcarce got up one, but they diſcovered, as well as ſight could diſcerne, a moſt faire City, which for the quantity of Buildings, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Gardens, the highneſſe of the Walls, made them imagine it one of the greateſt, of the ſtrongeſt, and the moſt delitious of the World. They alſo perceived, not very far from them, a moſt majeſtick Palace, which rather buried than hid with the thickneſſe of the trees, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not liberty to the eye to ſee the beauties of it; They went towards it, but loſing their way they ſtood ſtill, weary, and daunted. Diſaſters, hunger, and the voyage, had ſo afflicted the Princeſſe, that ſhe acknowledged her ſelfe unable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169974:8"/>to move a ſtep further. <hi>Celardo</hi> beſeeched her to repoſe her ſelfe at the foot of that Hill in a Plaine till he had gone to ſpeak with ſome body, and ſhould bring her ſome hope of a Lodging, and ſome comfort to her wearineſſe. The Palace they had diſcovered, of neceſſity could not be very far off, and that it agreed not with poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that a Country ſo rich and fertile ſhould not be infinite full of people. The Princeſſe conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and laying her downe upon the graſſe, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Love and Fortune that had dealt ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily with her, that now ſhe hoped for no greater conſolation than to loſe her life. Ever &amp; anon ſhe breathed out moſt hot ſighs, which accompanied with an abundancy of teares would have awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſenſe of pity in the fierceneſſe of Tygers, and in the hardneſſe of Rocks. Whiles her Paſſions tranſported her heart into a thouſand thoughts, ſhe perceived from afar her ſelfe to be called with reiterated voices; She aroſe not without feare, and caſting her eyes to that part where ſhe heard her name ſo redoubled, ſhe ſaw it was the Duke, who in all haſte deſcended the Mountaine; ſhe accounted her ſelfe a dead woman. There was not a Deity in heaven which ſhe did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore. She would have fled, but oppreſſed either with wearineſſe, or feare, ſhe was conſtrained, to keepe her from falling, to leane to a ſtone, which butted out from all the other of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; ſhe hardly touched it but it ſtirred of it ſelfe, as if ſtones had that pity which ſhe could not find in men; She thruſt it a little back, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169974:8"/>perceived that it damm'd up the entrance of a very large Cave, as might be gueſſed at the firſt ſight. It was there with ſuch Art hung upon Hinges, that very eaſily it cloſed up, and opened the Paſſage. Without, the greatneſſe of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much leſſe, and in ſuch wiſe it was ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, that it ſeemed Nature had produced it, and that it was not a Fabrick of Art. It opened inwardly, and when it was ſecured with the Bolt all the force of the World could not ſuffice to ſtirre it. The Princeſſe remained a while doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; ſhe conceited ſhe dreamed, or elſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelfe, that the Gods, moved to pity by her teares, had diſcovered this place of ſhelter, which could only preſerve her honeſty, and life. It appeared ſtrange to her to be buried by her ſelfe in a Cave; But the preſent feare of falling againe into the Dukes hands made her careleſs of conſidering future dangers. Being entred into the Grott, and fearing to be purſued, ſhe ſecured the Mouth of it with ſome ſmall Barre, which ſtood by for that purpoſe. Then ſhe went haſtily towards where ſhe ſaw a great light, and came into a Court, which being adorned with moſt beautifull Pillars, and of the fineſt Marble, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared rather to be a receptacle of the Gods than a Sepulchre of men, as ſhe had imagined. It had in the midſt of it a moſt large Fountaine, which from ſeven Statues of the beſt poliſhed Alabaſter ſent forth faire and criſtalline waters: Here the Princeſſe ſtaied, and her thirſt allaied, occaſioned by feare and labour, doubtfull in her
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169974:9"/>ſelfe what ſhe ſhould hope for in theſe extreames of her miſery; ſhe was over-taken by a ſweet ſleep, the effect either of her wearineſſe, or the murmur of thoſe waters.</p>
            <p>The Duke in the meane while, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſt ſight of her while he deſcended the Hill, arrived at the Rock where he ſuppos'd her hid. He ſtood aſtoniſhed when he ſaw no place for ſuch a purpoſe, and that ſhe could not have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his eyes, if ſhe were not transformed into thoſe Rocks. Nevertheleſs he forbore not to ſearch with his hands if it were poſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any Entrance. Whiles he remained in this anxious ſollicitude, that he could neither credit his ſight nor touch, he heard himſelfe railed at by a voice not known to him. Turning himſelf ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, he perceived it was a Knight with a naked ſword in his hand, that uttered thoſe words, and now defied him to the Battell, menacing death to him. The Duke retiring backwards ſome few paces, ſuddenly drew his ſword, and ſaid: Thou art come hither at this time to ſatiate the juſtice of my Anger. I will, that thou giveſt me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Princeſſe who can be no bodies but mine; That Knight hearing the name of Princeſſe, encountered him with ſuch a fury, that notwithſtanding any defence the Duke could make, he began to treat him ſo fouly, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed to defend his life than offend his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; Yet not ſhewing the leaſt ſigne of baſeneſs, his foot ſlipping, he fell down in a ſownd, ready to dye, I know not whether by reaſon of his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169974:9"/>wounds, or fall; Although the Knight was even blinded with paſſion, and his wrath he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it unagreeing to his generous ſpirit to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell to a Carkaſs; not being able to imagine who he ſhould be by the lineaments of his face, though he had a very great deſire to have received ſome information, ſuppoſing him dead he departed, though himſelfe was in danger of his life, not ſo much of the wounds he received of the Duke, which were only two, and of ſmall conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as for griefe he found within himſelfe. He would not go toward the City, reſolving to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe into ſome place, where far from thoſe Objects that might increaſe the torments of his mind, he might paſs over the wretched remnant of thoſe yeares which Fortune promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Celardo</hi> in the interim having followed that Path which appeared moſt beaten, after a long compaſs having found no body that could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him of any houſe, or the ſtate of the Country, he came where he heard a noiſe of weapons. He ſaw an old man, that with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable dexterity and ſtrength defended himſelfe from the blows of foure Knights, who with no ordinary valour aſſaulted him for his life. His back he ſecured by a great Tree, and with ſuch a readineſs managed his ſword, that in that une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall fight he left not his enemies hope of their lives, much leſs of victory. He had nevertheleſs received three wounds, two in the thigh, and one in the head, which though not mortall, yet blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169974:10"/>extreamely began to make him faint. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardo,</hi> although he preferred his returne to the Princeſs, could not curbe the bravery of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and undauntedneſs which he had from his birth: He perſwaded himſelfe that at two blowes he ſhould free himſelfe from thoſe, who ſhewing themſelves traitours, could not be but cowards. Firſt, he began with his voice, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his hands to encourage the mind of the old Knight, who now looked to nothing but to ward himſelfe. At the firſt blow he ſtroke down one, who to ſhew himſelfe the valianteſt would precede his Companions in death. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of them, bleeding infinitely, deſpairing of life, hardly able to ſuſtaine himſelfe on his legs, uniting all the forces of his laſt ſtrength, threw his ſword, halfe whereof only remained in his hands. It hit the old man on the Face, who aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with it, dropt down, whiles the other ready to dye fell by him. <hi>Celardo</hi> in very ſhort time killed the other two, having received two hurts, one in his left arme, and the other in the right ſhoulder. He ran haſtily to the old Knight, who now aroſe from the ground, and came to thanke him, he having preſerved his life. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, how he found himſelfe of his wounds, perceiving him bloudy, and rejoyced much when he underſtood they were of little moment, whilſt he hoped his own were not mortall. He invited him to be cured in a houſe of his not far off thence, where he had a deſire to expreſſe ſome ſigne of his gratitude; ſaying, it was not his cuſtome to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169974:10"/>be altogether overcome by benefits, and that he would correſpond to the Obligation with thoſe ſervices that his preſent Fortune afforded him. <hi>Celardo,</hi> thanking the Knight, replied, That a Lady that depended on his protection, to whom (by his owne choice) he had engaged his heart, and that now by deſtiny called on him to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Functions of his Debt, remained not far off expecting him, where he would much rather leave his life than to be wanting in any thing ſhe could look for from him, both for the ſatisfaction of his promiſe, and the obligation of his faith; That teaching him the way he ſhould receive lodging as a ſingular courteſie, being himſelfe a ſtranger in ſtrange Countries. The old Knight ſeemed ſatisfied: but by any meanes he would accompany him to guide him after back to his own houſe. They proceeded not far in theſe Complements, more courteous than neceſſary to the buſineſſe of their wounds, which ſwelled and ſmarted ſo that they could hardly ſtand, much leſſe undertake a journey. <hi>Celardo</hi> enflamed with anger againſt himſelfe, that he could not ſuffer an ill of ſo little value was ready to run mad, when galloping at full ſpeed a moſt beautifull Virgin arrived there, attended on by eight Squires all armed, and on horſeback, to the aid of the old Knight. She rejoyced infinitely, finding him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and in a ſtate of health, being come thither with an opinion that ſhe ſhould rather revenge than ſuccour him. She ran haſtily with teares of joy to embrace him, and with a certaine balſame
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169974:11"/>ſhe had purpoſely brought thither, ſhe annointed his wounds, which although not mortall, were for all that very conſiderable by the loſſe of much bloud. Before ſhe attempted to cure that on his head, to the great amazement of <hi>Celardo,</hi> ſhe took off that beard, and thatvery long haire which was falſe, and made him ſeeme much ancienter than he was. Having bound up the wounds of the Knight, now reſtored to youth againe, ſhe did the ſame to <hi>Celardo,</hi> who was much more hurt than he imagined. Being mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, by the help of the Squires, they all went to look the Princeſs, although with a civill vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <hi>Celardo</hi> had beſeeched them to returne home, leaving a Squire with him to ſerve him as a Guide. They arrived at the Plaine, where <hi>Celardo,</hi> not finding the Princeſs, had died for griefe, if <hi>Oleandro</hi> and <hi>Arnalta,</hi> for ſo was the Knight and Damoſell called, had not comforted him, and overcome him with perſwaſions, and prayers, that he ſhould not be cruell to himſelfe: Nor had he been won to have departed from that Mountaine, if conquered by the violence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had not loſt his ſenſes. <hi>Oleandro</hi> with all ſpeed commanded a chaire to be made of the boughs of thoſe trees, and as well as he could made him be carried to his houſe, which was not above three miles off. It was ſcituated in the midſt of a Plaine, which with the length and breadth of it tooke up the ſpace of ten miles. About it ran a very deep River, which rendred the ſcituation of it no leſs faire than ſtrong.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169974:11"/>There were ſome engines to overflow all the ground with, to the height of a man, which at the ſame time both made the earth fertile, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it from treacheries.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Celardo</hi> was laid, they procuring all meanes for him, either uſefull to end the cure of of his Body, or trouble of his mind. Six daies he remained in danger of his life, and if <hi>Arnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> with her diligences, or at leaſt with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had not brought him ſome remedy, he had been in danger to have falne into the hands of death. Many times ſhe had told him, That to deſpaire was the laſt of evills; That if the Lady, whom with ſo great a feeling of ſorrow he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned, were dead, teares were ſuperfluous, if alive, not neceſſary. That living he might find out ſome meanes to content his affections, but ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomly to give over himſelfe to dye, beſides the ſigne of a courage leſs than ordinary, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived that Lady of a Protectour, and himſelfe of any hope ever to ſatisfie thoſe Obligations he profeſſed ſo great to her. What cannot reaſons effect, proceeding from a mouth that knows to perſwade even without words! <hi>Celardo</hi> with a ſilent anſwer acknowledged himſelfe convinced, and attended nothing but the recovery of his health. Nevertheleſs ſometimes he could not be ſo alienate from himſelfe by his paine, as not to fix his memory on the Princeſs. He accuſed his negligence in leaving a Lady of ſo high deſcent, in a Countrey not known, and in a Wood to the mercy of Beaſts, and not men only; He blamed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169974:12"/>Fortune, that having delivered her into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was a Tyrant to him, making him loſe her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had well got her. Laſtly, he was angry with the ſtarres, that had not ſuffered him to be borne, but to ſee him alwaies miſerable.</p>
            <p>One day, that he by himſelfe was thinking on his misfortunes, he was ſurpriſed by <hi>Oleandro,</hi> who was now cured, and came, as he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed, to viſit him. He bluſh'd to ſee himſelfe ſo taken, endeavouring to conceale thoſe teares that apace fell from him. He would not communicate his ſorrows to any but himſelfe, eſteeming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints unbeſeeming a Knight, being only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the weakeneſſe of women. <hi>Oleandro</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to give a ſtop to his grief, began thus to ſpeake to him. If I had not theſe eyes witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of your vertue, I ſhould forme ſome ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter opinion of your courage. I cannot bethinke me, how a mind that is greater than Fortune, and hath meanes in its own power to raiſe Glories to it ſelfe, can ſubmit to the violence of ſorrow, ſo much the more unſeaſonable, becauſe it hath no foundation above opinion and feare. I ſpeake freely, becauſe the acquaintance that is between us, and the Obligation that I have profeſt to you, will not permit I ſhould bely the thoughts of my heart. To lament too much is to betray ones ſelfe. It was not fit thoſe ſhould be borne and live that will not be aimed at by the ſtroke of deſtiny. We are all equally made lyable to infortunities. And this humane condition of ours hath no greater certainty than to be engaged to all Accidents;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169974:12"/>with this law we came into the World, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween termes ſo unhappily hath Nature placed us, as to have no ſence of it on one ſide, is a ſigne of ſtupidity: ſo to deſpaire at it is altogether the effect of weakeneſs. The body will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exerciſe thoſe functions to which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by the corruption of its beginning, yet notwithſtanding, it is neceſſary that the mind which hath the ſoveraignity of power over it, ſhould calme thoſe motions that may depreſs the virtue of the Intellect. Senſe ought never to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome reaſon, but in thoſe who have no other reaſon but ſenſe.</p>
            <p>He would have proceeded farther, but <hi>Celardo</hi> prevented him, ſaying, Theſe opinions were true yet to be wiſh'd for. Every Phyſitian knows how to forbid that to another which he will not deny to himſelfe. That there is nothing leſs eaſie than to give Counſell: and that the tongue is eaſier to be moved than the heart. <hi>Oleandro</hi> replied, he ſpake not at randome, but could authenticate his Maximes by examples. And that if it would not be troubleſome for him to heare, he would let him know all the circumſtances of his Fortune, which alwaies would have enthralled him to ſorrow, but that he with a generous ſufferance made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thought one of the happieſt men in the World. <hi>Celardo</hi> ſhewing a great curioſity to know, profeſſing he had been ſilent of his own deſires, for fear he might offend him, conſtreined him with a kind of affectionate violence to the diſcourſe of his misfortunes.</p>

               <head>The Hiſtory of <hi>Oleandro.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I, ſaid <hi>Oleandro,</hi> in deſpight of Fate, that could deprive me of a Kingdome, but not of the Character of a Prince; am King of <hi>Morocco:</hi> My Father, in one yeares ſpace, lamented the death of his Queen, the Rape of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the loſſe of his Kingdome, and the ruine of his Houſe: Seeing that Fortune had torne her ſaile, and bound up her haire, not to tranſport elſewhere, the effects of her inconſtancie, and the bitterneſſe of her griefes, he abandon'd the wretched remnants, which the inſatiate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe of his enemies had not plundered from him. But before his departure, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to <hi>Felido</hi> Count of <hi>Olano,</hi> a Prince of the blood, of an experimented virtue, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of me and my life. He was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in his Election: In his private fortune he had his Education from the Prince. There was not any thing which could awaken, or moleſt my deſigne, which I did not attaine to. Vertue was my employment, exerciſe on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back my profeſſion, and hunting my paſtime. He, when he perceiv'd the nobleneſſe of my Genius, ſeeing me alſo ſixteen yeares of Age, he perſwaded me to the recovery of my Fathers Kingdome: That ſloth was the worſt of evils; and that theſe yeares ſhould not be ſlighted which ſo ſpeedily paſſe away. That old mens courages very hardly provoke the commonaltie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169974:13"/>to an innovation of Government: As much as he delaies his Claime, ſo much he loſes of his Cauſe; with three Maximes likewiſe he tied the affections of the chiefe that were obliged to the memory of my Father, the news of his death after his departure, being every where verified. He findes them moſt ready who hate the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, compaſſionate my misfortunes; they ſee in my Perſon, the Spirits of my Progenitors flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and cannot away with that new Modell of Government, which being unjuſt, cannot be but cruell. They prepare Arms and Souldiers, and excite thoſe affectionated to the Crown, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the neighbour Princes with all poſſible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; when the enemies advertiz'd, either from jealouſie, the protectour of Eſtates, or feare, the diſcoverer of dangers, or from the reports of Fame, which cannot even conceale the Dreams of Princes, glutted themſelves with all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme with the lives of thoſe that maintain'd my Title. The Count ſeeing in the night time, the principalleſt of his Forts betraied by the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of his, not by the Valour of the Enemie; regarding more my ſafety then his own, let me out at a private Gate, diſguis'd in poor cloths, while he put on mine, and made himſelfe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a deceit, that my eſcape being known, I ſhould not be purſued.</p>
               <p>Death will be the leaſt of his evils; for beſides the envy of his Emulatours, he had the hate of the Tyrants, who infinitely often at any price had requeſted my life of him; my diſguiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169974:14"/>me ſafe from every danger, nor miſt I any thing that offended me: I departed from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> deploring my misfortune, that would not permit me an occaſion to exerciſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſſe of my heart, or the ſtrength of my ſword. I embark'd for <hi>Numidia,</hi> to tug, if Fortune would change by the alteration of <hi>Climes.</hi> The injuries of Tempeſts, of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of Lightnings, accompanied me in my Voyage. When one is once made the ſcope of the miſeries of fate, he only knows what 'tis to be unhappy.</p>
               <p>I came aſhore in <hi>Dana,</hi> a Region of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi> becauſe deſtiny there had provided for me greater miſeries. Afoot I walked toward <hi>Teſſet,</hi> the Metropolis of the Kingdome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the ſorrow of thoſe thoughts which had almoſt made me beyond my ſelfe; the Heaven ſerved for my Canopy, and my griefe for a Centinell, which admitted me not to have the multiplicity of wild Beaſts, which <hi>Africke</hi> breeds: I was foure miles ſhort of <hi>Teſſet,</hi> when I felt my eares ſtruck with ſchreekes and lamentations of a faire woman. Shee fled from Death, which the trechery of four privy Murtherers menaced her with. Her cloths were extreamely rich, which ſhewed her to be a Lady of no ordinary deſcent. Her embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pearle, and gold, were out-vide by the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of her Face, and the beauty of her haire, which ſtirr'd up and downe by the wind and raining; it ſeems they were moved towards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169974:14"/>Heaven, to contend for ſplendour with that of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> her beautie not at all diminiſhed by feare, made me admire how it did not ſtirre up aide in the cruelty of thoſe hearts. Shee ſcarce ſaw me, but both with her love and by ſignes, ſhee implor'd my aide. Her entreaties were delivered with ſuch an inbred ſtatelineſſe, that they ſeem'd rather commands then prayers. I ſodainly laid hand on my ſword, and juſtice favoring me in deſpight of my ill fortune, they all there loſt their lives. Shee ranne to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me thanks, having ſeen vengeance taken of her enemies, without hurt to my ſelfe. After ſome few ſhort complements, ſhe told me the danger her Father was in; ſhewing me the way to him, I went to him with all ſpeed, and ſaved his life, who was incompaſs'd with moſt eminent dangers. Their kind embraces, and the honours they did me, amaz'd me. Theſe were the King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and his daughter, that tracing a Stag, had loſt themſelves, and were aſſaulted by thoſe <hi>Arabians,</hi> who with their Nurſes milk, ſucke in hatred to that Crown. I rendred thanks to the gods, and Fortune, who now grew weary to afflict me with an infelicity of ſucceſſes. I accounted my ſelfe bleſt, onely for preſerving from Death ſo great a King, and ſo faire a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. No body can be thought happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, who hath not tride all accidents: The faireneſſe of a day is not deſpair'd of for the Cloudes, which are ſeen before Sunne-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Our wounds were hardly bound up, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169974:15"/>the Courtiers came upon us, who with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of care, pour'd forth their vowes for their Princes ſafety. They conducted us into <hi>Teſſet,</hi> where we were encountred with thoſe applauſes, wherewith Subjects manifeſt their affections. At the foot of the Palace ſtaires was the Queen accompanied with a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, attended by a multitude of Ladies. They rain'd from their eyes, two moſt lively ſhowers of teares, which iſſue not alwaies from the fountaine of ſorrow; whom they had lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for dead, with his daughter, they cannot yet be ſatisfied to ſee alive and embrace. Thank, (ſaid the King) this Knight pointing to me, from whoſe Valour next to the gods, I acknowledge my ſafety and life; I profeſs my ſelfe in ſo high a manner beholding to him, that ſhould I give him my Crown, I ſhould not in part have paid what I owe him; for it is his, and I receiv'd it from him, both through his good fortune and courteſy. The modeſt conceit I had of my ſelfe forced me with bluſhes to anſwer his good opinion of me. I was made his companion in the Palace, and a while after, one of his Royall Councell; and by many that flattered their own hopes in my greatneſs, I was almoſt reverenc'd, as the Heire and ſucceſsour of the Kingdome. My mind exalted by the beginning of theſe felicities loſt within a few dayes, the remembrance of its misfortunes. The thoughts of regaining my Fathers Kingdome, and to eaſe my ſubjects of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169974:15"/>their miſeries, the love that I took to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta Ariama,</hi> at that time I freed her from the ravenouſneſſe of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> drove out of my mind. The benignity of her favours, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of her countenance, the continuation of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, would have ſubdued the obdurateneſſe of any heart, not onely mine, eaſy to receive any impreſſion through the weakneſs of youth and in experience. Diſſemblings ſome few daies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd my fire, which preſently after becomming inſupportable, made me ſubject to a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſickneſſe. The King, carefull for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, aſſiſted at my bed, comforted me in my undiſcovered ſorrows, and bemoan'd me as if it were his own diſeaſe. The Phyſitians deſpairing to find out the cauſe, refus'd to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit me, having no hope at all left them of my life.</p>
               <p>I did receive no other comfort, but from the Preſence of my faire <hi>Infanta.</hi> Not only my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but life depended on the ſight of her. One day the Queen and the Princeſſe, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at the conſultation of the Phyſitians, or becauſe ſhee ſaw in the ſadneſſe of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the bitterneſſe of my ſorrowes, or becauſe ſhe read in my eyes, the indeleble Characters of my affection, with much adoe refraining from teares, ſhee ſaid to me. Then (O Knight) ſhall your obſtinacie deprive us of your Perſon! Is it poſſible, that diſſimulation is more prevalent over your will, then my entreaties! If you deny this, not to receive
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169974:16"/>redreſſe for your Maladie, confeſſe it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me. I love you Sir, for the debt of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I owe you, and by the election of my will; without you I cannot, neither will I live. Diſcouer then your griefs, either that they may meet with remedy, or to comfort them with the companie of my teares. I that was troubled with no other griefe, but with doubtfull thoughts of her affection, and the poorneſſe of my Fortune, although borne a Prince, and whom feare of repulſe had made rather chooſe death then her diſdaine; at the ſound of theſe words, felt my ſpirits reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and believ'd my ſelfe well. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my ſelfe for joy, I thus anſwered; Faire <hi>Infanta,</hi> my griefes have had originall from your beauty, I have conceal'd in the cinders of diſſimulation thoſe fires that turne my heart into aſhes: My poor merit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to your reall greatneſs, rendred the deſires of my affection impoſſible. I rather preferr'd to encounter death, then occaſion your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Now that the exceſses of your benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have embolden'd me with theſe words, I will lay open before you my moſt inward wounds, and I attend from the favours of your munificence that helpe which the knowledge of my condition denies me. If the care of your maladie (replied the <hi>Infanta</hi>) depend upon my will, riſe, for you are well. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of your deſires ſhall have their end, and correſpondencie in my affection. Doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169974:16"/>me to flatter my hopes, for you know what love can doe in the breaſt of a woman, that will and knowes to love.</p>
               <p>The arrivall of the Mother and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, with Phyſitians, broke off the continuance of this diſcourſe, who found in me extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſignes of an unexpected health. They were amaz'd at ſo ſodaine an alteration, and blam'd the imperfection of their Art, that (foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reaſons of it upon an experience alter'd by the diverſity of complexions) aſtoniſh'd them at my amendment, as if they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of my diſeaſe; Yet there was among them, ſome that made a doubt of my life. They were fixd upon a rule, though common, fallacious; that in a body extenuated by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, griev'd by infirmitie, and ſtreitned of remedies, Nature would not be wanting of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to receive extraordinary helpes; And theſe they ſaid were the laſt ſtrengths of it. Experience contradicted their reaſons: They ſoone ſaw my amendment, being durable, had reall foundations. The ſtrength of my body they increaſed with moſt pretious meats, but with regard to the quantitie, which at firſt they denied me, leſt the digeſtion interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſuffocated, ſhould bring me into a more dangerous ſickneſs afterwards. Plenty of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and the viſits of the Phyſitians, and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the moſt beautifull <hi>Infanta,</hi> recover'd me. Thoſe few daies I kept my bed in. I endeavoured to contrive how we might enjoy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169974:17"/>the pleaſures of our deſire, as a ſign of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhee had beſtowed kindly a kiſs on me, I having formerly told her my birth, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her my faith. Shee obliged her ſelfe, when I was healed to bring me into her lodgings, my deſire made me well before my time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſhee deceive me in her promiſe. She truſted her thoughts and affections to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Corona,</hi> beſeeching her aſſiſtance. Shee to diſswade her, made uſe of all reaſons and entreaties, but in vaine: Love hath not reaſon, nor receives perſwaſion contrary to the will of them that love. Feare repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her prodigies of my ruine: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhee doubted whether ſhee had beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to the King. But the good will ſhee bore the Princeſs, and high opinion ſhee had of me, witheld her. She aided us to the fruition of our, loves impoſſible, but by her means.</p>
               <p>The ſevereneſs of this happineſs, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but for a very little while: In the which I had conſulted with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> of reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of her Father, Armes and Mony, for the regaining of my Kingdome; when Fortune, that till now had made truce with my griefs, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited all the forces of her ſtrength to ruine me. This ſhort calme ſerv'd to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to make me truſt to her, intending to make me drinke of a Sea of miſerie. The Princeſs <hi>Arelida</hi> became enamour'd of me, who with divers and extraordinary favours forced her ſelfe to diſcover her affections. At
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169974:17"/>Dancings ſhee would alwaies dance with me; at Huntings, be even with me, and at Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, give me conſtantly her Favour to weare: whence ſhee would have me take notice, that exceſſive honours proceeded not from an ordinary affection; I counterfeited with ſuch cunning to take no notice of it, that ſhee found her ſelfe prevented and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But becauſe the power of Love receives no hinderance from modeſty; one day fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her ſelfe indiſpos'd, ſhee made me be call'd to her, and after ſome courteous Complements paſt, ſhe thus ſpoke to me.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible (<hi>Oleandro</hi>) that I ſhould be ſo little skill'd in the practiques of Love, and you ſo knowing of his Favours! Some few daies agoe, I know not what provoked me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my flame. Your modeſty, or my ill luck blinded you. I am deſirous to reſtore your ſight, finding my heart too narrow for ſo overflowing exceſses of Love. Deare friend <hi>Oleandro,</hi> I love you; if you believe not my tongue, the interpreter of my mind, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full revealer of my intentions, give credit to theſe teares, true ſignes of an extraordinary affection, and blood of my heart. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of your conditions, the honeſtie of your actions, the ſublimity of your mind, and the comelineſs of your countenance, tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the freeneſs of my will, the greatneſs of my Birth, the modeſtie of my conditions, and the bluſhes of my face. I ſhould have fear'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169974:18"/>rather to have gain'd by this boldneſſe your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, then affection, if I knew not your worth ſo great, that it would excuſe even the errours of Princeſſes. She offends not, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes her affection on a deſerving object. The gods rejoice to be beloved by all. The Lawes of <hi>Cupid</hi> puniſh the ingratefull that love not, not thoſe that doe: Nor is there any ſuch thing, that honeſtie is contrary to affection; For I love you with a deſire to live with you as a wife, not to enjoy you as a ſervant, my birth is not capable of ſo baſe thoughts; my deſires have no meaning that may blemiſh the candidneſſe of their ends. If you be a Prince, as I ſhall not believe you if you denie it, you have no reaſon to refuſe my Nuptials; I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping both by the Law of Nature, and right of ſucceſſion, to be a Queen: If you be not of ſo high a condition, you ought then to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this occaſion that invites you to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of me, and thereby of the Kingdome. If you diſcerne any want in any of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, my affection ought to have power over the hardneſſe of your thoughts, to win you to afford me your conſent. The World hath not treaſure enough to recompenſe the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Princeſſe: Correſpondence alone is the onely reward of love. Love me then, and with an obſtinate reſolution diſdaine not the benignity of Fortune, which proffers you the posſeſſion of a beauty, eſteemed ſingular by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have deſired it, and the ſoveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169974:18"/>ſo great a people, that would even weary the ambition of an <hi>Alexander!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With theſe words the Princeſſe ſet a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to her ſpeech, attending with great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind (giving ſignes thereof, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours in her face, and with ſubmiſſe entreaties of her eyes) my anſwer. A while I ſtood ſilent; after I reflected, that to make a Princeſſe hopeleſſe of her love, would prove a Precipice to my affections: That women are not accuſtomed to receive denials in thoſe things, which for the moſt part are proffered them before hand. That bluſh that inflames the countenance of a Princeſs to gaine the Love of her beloved, if refus'd, is converted into ſcorne, to take from her eyes the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her rejection. Therefore after ſome Complements, thanking her noble diſpoſition, that (without any regard of my condition) had enriched me with the graces of her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I beſeeched her to remember the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Birth, the pooreneſs of my ſtate, and the frownes of his Majeſtie, the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſubjects; and laſty, that her love ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no foundation of Merit, was likely in ſhort time to decay, and leave me in danger of my life; and that her ſelfe (with it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into dislike) to glorifie her deſires, and conceale her bluſhes, would procure mee harme with ſuch like reaſons; ſome dayes I entertain'd the enamour'd Princeſs, who deceiv'd by an appearance, of theſe excuſes, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169974:19"/>me ſo far from conſenting to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Laſtly; one day while I was walking in a Garden, ſhee came and tooke me by the hand, and led me under an Arbour, where any bodies curioſities could not diſcover us, and earneſtly beſeech'd me, either to conſent to her deſires, or to diſcloſe mine. That my excuſes were apparent; That the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a Princeſſe ought not to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though the doubts of misfortune were neer. Whereupon, not enduring any longer the importunity of her Prayers, ſeing the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe brought to ſuch a paſſe, that Lenitives were no longer neceſſary, I tooke upon me a reſolution to undeceive her; for I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to doe ſo with my <hi>Infanta,</hi> who, forth of jealouſie, had had a falling out with me. She had told me, that wantonizings were the baits of Love, and that my body loved not any, who had not confidence to be beloved; becauſe coy hearts never take the mindes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>I replyed therefore; Princeſſe, it would be a greater impiety to conceale my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from you, then ſtrive to give you a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. That would be a crime of my will, this is a fault of deſtiny, the more excuſable, becauſe it is not in my power. A thouſand praiſes, a thouſand gratious ſignes teſtify your love, with confuſion to my ſelfe, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it, being in a condition unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite you. I have had no other deſert in me
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169974:19"/>for ſo many favours, but the Nobleneſſe of your affection: To which though I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied correſpondencie, I am ſo much the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier of pardon, that ſeeing I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo manifeſt an errour, it yet ought to be imputed to the violence of the Starres, and not to any defect in my will. The feeling that my ſoule receives in not being able to ſerve your commands, ſhould in part free you from the paſſions of your heart. Releaſe your ſelfe from loving me, with the conſideration that I am unworthy to be beloved by you, becauſe I cannot returne affection, Princeſſe, I cannot, neither will I love you. My thoughts are fix'd, my promiſe made, my heart engag'd. A Princeſſe of ſo much merit, to whom, even the affections of the Gods are due, ought not to procure the leavings of that heart, that knowes not which way, and cannot love her.</p>
               <p>Her eares had hardly received theſe laſt words, but with a generous diſdaine, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away my hands which were between hers, and riſing up in a fury, ſhee parted thence without anſwering me. I feared leſt that mind, provoked by the ſtings of revenge, ſhould contrive ſome plot againſt my life. All things are eaſie to the diſdaine of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Love. The authority of a Princeſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by affection and fury, findes no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility that can appoint it limits: But ſhe freed me from ſuſpition, by ſeeing her not a jot altered by theſe ſucceſses; with the ſame
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169974:20"/>gentleneſs as formerly, ſhe continued with all freedome her favours to me. Yet, although I was delivered from my feares, I reſolved to remove that object that might offend her memory by her eyes. I reſolved to intreate aide of his Majeſty for the reconquering of my Kingdome; the <hi>Infanta</hi> conſenting to it, rather not to offend my deliberations, then for any hope ſhee yet had of good ſucceſs by it: One evening, when I had not been brought to her Chamber by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Corana,</hi> being abed, and thinking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of a new Kingdome, untill after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, I heard I knew not who, making a little noiſe with a low voice pronounce my name. I haſtily rouſed up my ſelfe, laying hand on my ſword, when I ſaw one that I knew not, who with a little Candle came to me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering me a note. Having received it, he ſodainly departed, none of my ſervants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him, or hearing of him. With a great alteration which I found in my ſelfe, I opened it, and knew the Character, for it was the hand of the <hi>Infanta:</hi> It ſaid thus;</p>
               <p>Friend, we are diſcovered, I am a Priſoner, and you will be betrai'd if you fly not. You ſhall find at the Golden Gate, the ſignet Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, Armes, Mony, and a guide; delay not, for the danger is great; Preſerve your life, and follow your guide. I was of a ſodaine aſsaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with variety of thoughts: It appeared to me an act of baſeneſs, to confeſs my ſelfe by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169974:20"/>my flight guilty of a greater fault, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I was. To leave the Infanta a prey to the fury of the King, ſeemed unſupportable. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that delay could not be but dangerous, and that alſo the Reaſons of my own Innocency, with leſs perill would be treated on, being farre from the Judge, and with more reputation: That my ſtay would be unprofitable to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who with teares would proſecute the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of a Father ſo affectionate; and that laſtly, the hopes of the Kingdome of <hi>Morocco</hi> ſhould not be ſhut up in a Priſon, I made no ſtay, having put up ſome Jewels, and the Picture of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta, without ſpeaking a word to any of mine, I went to the Gate, I found there what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me. The Guide was a Knight richly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, with two Squires who waited for me with Armes. I being armed, the Knight ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> away the Squires, and we travail'd toward the Dukedome of <hi>Riano,</hi> making all haſte, without ſpeaking a word. We came into the midd'ſt of a thick wood: I cautious of the truth of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, between anxieties of a thouſand Paſſions, beſeeched the Knight to make the tediouſneſs of the way cheerefull with Diſcourſe, and with his Relations to withdraw my minde from appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of evill; that to fix ones Intellect upon Adverſity, was more hurtfull then Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes themſelves. He ſtaying a while in ſuſpence, after ſome interrupted ſighes began thus to ſpeak to me:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oleandro,</hi> our owne common obſtinacy hath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169974:21"/>brought us hither to loſe Reputation, and life. Behold the Princeſs <hi>Arelida</hi> deſpis'd and ſcorn'd, brought into this Habit by a violent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. When you reveal'd your thoughts to me, I knew of your favour with the <hi>Infanta:</hi> I diſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a while, the better to break them off. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, imitating her hand, I have deceived you for deceiving me. I rejoyce that I ſhall puniſh with Honour and with bloud, your ingratitude, and my folly. The unquietneſs of your minde will give reſt to my ſoule: I ſhall carry to my Tombe this ſatisfaction, that my Rivall ſhall be deprived of your Embraces, you my Enemy defamed in Reputation, an Exile from your owne content; and that I a Tyrant to my own Felicity, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that reward which my Diſsoluteneſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. Doe not beleeve that I am covetous of the leaving of your love, I abhorre the memory of it, as much as I have deſired the obtaining of it: And to loſe all remembrance of it, I care not to have my life. So ſaying, whilſt I was ſtudying Reaſons to diſswade her, and a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how to carrie my ſelfe, ſhe mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelfe with a Dagger between the joynts of her Armour, I having no time to prevent her. I remained ſo confus'd at theſe Accidents, that I doubted I dreamed, or that my eyes deceiv'd me. But recovering my ſenſe, I forced my ſelfe to content her. I told her what an unworthineſs it was to be ſo cruell againſt her ſelfe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her of her birth, and of the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of infamy; and that to be murthered by her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169974:21"/>ſelfe was no other but an act of weakneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming to have harbour in thoſe breaſts which by Heaven are ſelected to command. Having taken off her Armes, I would have bound up her wound, (although ſhe with all her ſtrength deny'd that that body ſhould receive a Salve whoſe minde was incurable) when I found my ſelfe ſet on by a Troop of Arabians, ſuch as murthered by the high-way. I had ſcarce time to leap on horſe-back, when they fell upon me to have ſlaine me. I defended my ſelfe with ſo good Fortune, that I kill'd the moſt of them; the reſt giving themſelves over to feare, thought their ſafety lay in their flight. I that was hot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Revenge, and deſperate in my miſeries, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered my ſelfe to be tranſported to the Mountains, where killing three of them, I loſt my horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded by one of them in the Breaſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in vain I ſought a path to find the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by; but the Trees were very thick, the Rocks inacceſſible, the Deſcent difficult, and the way (through my haſte) not obſerved. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having compaſs'd and recompaſs'd much ground to no purpoſe, untill the dawning of the day, being overcome by paſsion and wearineſs, I laid me downe to reſt me. I fell into an interrupted ſleep, acompanyed with illuſions ſo horrible, that they extreamly diſturb'd my Repoſe. Me thoughts I ſaw the Infanta (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine by her Father) to reprove me of weakneſſe that I ſhould leave her to be ſo vilely murthered, without affording her any help.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169974:22"/>Sometimes me thoughts the Princeſſe Ghoſt with ſo lively fears laid her hand on my heart, that in the vanity of a Dreame, I felt my ſelfe to dye in earneſt.</p>
               <p>Awaking a little after Sunne-riſing, hopeleſſe of finding the Princeſſe againe, I took that path which I thought led to the Sea ſhore. My ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination deceiv'd me not: There was a Galley of Pirats brought thither by neceſſity, to take in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of water: They willingly received me, I offering my ſelfe a Companion in their Labours, and to be ready upon all occaſions. They had Experience of me in the taking a Galley. They cruelly wounded, and retired to be dreſs'd, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſuſtained the violence of weapons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd my ſelfe ſo, that in a manner they all peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſave ſome Ladies, with the greateſt part of the Riches they brought with them. It was of little defence, and came rather to boaſt the Pomp of it then to fight. After having given neceſſary Orders for the Cure of the wounded, I comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Ladies, who with ſtormes of teares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored their misfortunes. They all fell at my feet: The chiefe of them diſtinguiſhed, and known by the reverence that the others ſhew'd her, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the loſſe of her liberty, nor in the fear of Death, loſt a whit of that beauty which made her ſingular from the reſt; with a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but generous earneſtneſſe ſhe intreated me to ſpare her honour and life. I giving her my word promiſed her alſo her Liberty, when it was not in my power to preſerve it: I felt my ſelfe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169974:22"/>then in a manner ſo ſtruck to the heart, that my words ſtuck in my mouth: I perceived within me an alteration, proceeding from an unknowne cauſe, that I was aſtoniſhed at my ſelfe. Thoſe Teares froze up my ſpirit: Thoſe Words mov'd my ſoule: Thoſe Sobs tormented my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo that becomming without motion, by a ſtrange ſtupidity, I found my ſelfe alienated from my ſelfe. At length adding force to my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I asked her her birth, her name, and the cauſe of their voiage. My name, ſhe replyed, is <hi>Arnalta;</hi> my Countrey the world: Being but two yeares of Age I was ſtole from my Parents, I was preſented to the King of <hi>Fracia,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no iſſue, adopted me for his Daughter, living in a great deſire to know my Origen, I Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked with the Kings conſent for the Fortunate Iſlands, where Fame reported, an Oracle gave Anſwer unto all Queſtions.</p>
               <p>While with theſe words, (delivered with ſo much ſweetneſſe that ſhe raviſhed my heart through my eares) ſhe ſatisfied my requeſt, I obſerv'd a Medall of Gold that hung about her neck, that had an <hi>Hydra</hi> ſlaine by a <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Impreſs of our Houſe engraven upon it. I broke off her Diſcourſe, beſeeching her how ſhe came by it. She anſwered, that with it ſhe was ſtolne, and given to the King. I that from my Father had underſtood the ſecret of this Medall; that it was a ſtone that ſtopt bleeding, that preſerv'd and freed from poiſon, though never ſo mortall, when I read inſerted in it my Mothers name, I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169974:23"/>was even readie to run mad for joy. I took her by the hand (obſerving not to be ſeen) and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to her all my miſeries, and diſcovered my ſelfe to be her Brother: I deſired her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble what had paſt, and to comfort her ſelfe in her Misfortunes, which had given her notice of her Birth. Then I went to viſit the wounded Pirats, to whom giving all the rich prize, I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted, and obtained <hi>Arnalta</hi> for my ſhare of it.</p>
               <p>We ſailed ſome daies through thoſe Seas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Adventure of Moment. One evening as I was going to bed, a ſouldier came in to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize me, that the Pirats were at Conſultation about my death. I drew neare to a chink of their Chamber, and heard one of them, who was nam'd <hi>Magorre,</hi> ſay to <hi>Ferrardo</hi> his brother; that to kil me arm'd would be a violent Remedy. The greateſt part of the ſouldiers were afraid of my valour, that all the ſlaves were obliged to my kindneſſe: And that thoſe Medicines which heale without offending are the moſt to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Poiſon might eaſily, and with their ſecuritie deprive me of life. The more ſucceſſefull their intention would prove, becauſe I did not ſo much as ſuſpect any ſhadow of treaſon. I preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated this unto ſome Souldiers, of whom I had received extraordinarie ſignes of affection. Theſe readily intereſting themſelves in my dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſet ſome ſlaves at liberty: Having armed them with a promiſe alſo of Freedome, they placed them in divers parts of the Galley, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169974:23"/>be more ready upon all occaſions. I reſolute with my ſword drawn my in hand, violently ruſhed into the Roome where they were plotting my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Magorre</hi> in a rage roſe to ſtrike me, when I, ere he was well up, with two wounds deprived him both of defence and life. <hi>Ferrardo</hi> in this while lanched out, and crying he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and upbraiding the ſouldiers of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, that without defending him would ſuffer him to periſh, he fortified himſelfe with a good part of the Souldiers in the Caſtle of <hi>Prora,</hi> which either for neceſſity or love undertook his defence. With their Bows they ſhot at thoſe that durſt approach any whit neare, and the death of foure rendred the reſt more fearefull and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of their Lives. There was not any meanes which I did not aſſay. I went notwithſtanding with a kind of reſervation, not willing to make uſe of fire, leſt it might offend <hi>Arnalta,</hi> and the Damzels that ſtood in a Tent under the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>They were a Fortification to themſelves; and not knowing the cauſe of the Tumult, and being certaine of nothing but feare, with their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſchreekes they implored my aide; not knowing what to reſolve, griefe almoſt made me mad. Scarce there was a thought entred into my mind, but refuting it I ſuddenly fell into new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which not perfected I alſo rejected.</p>
               <p>It was about day-break when the ſchreeks of <hi>Arnalta</hi> diſtinctly came to my eares, who invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked all the Deities of Heaven. A little while afterwards I plainely found ſhe was thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169974:24"/>the water; Although anger and ſorrow took away my ſenſes, I endeavoured nevertheleſs, with the power of prayers, and promiſe of rich gifts, to procure her life. Three without delay leapt into the ſea; many got into the Cock-boat; others caſt in Beames of wood, and Tables. All was in vaine; the skies were cloudy, the waves big, ſo that with difficulty we recovered them that had gone out. If a deſire of revenge had not ſomething counterpoiſed my fury I had flung my ſelfe into the ſea. But finally I reſolved to try my laſt endeavour: I made an Engine of boards ſtuffed with ſome packs of wooll, to ſecure us from their flings and Croſs-bows; And ſo ſome of mine that hoped for their liberty, and that found an opportunity to pull down ſome of their Rampiers, made an approach, and ſhot at the Pyrates, who ſoone finding themſelves in an ill condition, aimed at nothing but to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Ferrardo,</hi> while he was rayling at, and upbraiding my men, was ſhot with an Arrow, which wounding him in the mouth, tooke from him I know not firſt whether his tongue or life. His men now grown heartleſs, threw down their Armes, craving mercy, which had not been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them if the returne of thoſe Ladies had not pacified my wrath. For ſeeing <hi>Arnalta,</hi> whom I imagined drowned, I ran to embrace her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, as if I had only known her now. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Ferrardo,</hi> having forced the Tent, and requiring <hi>Arnalta</hi> by name (who for feare, and at the horrible ſight of that Pyrate) was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169974:24"/>falne in a ſwoone upon a Bed, one of her Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels anſwered him. He being deceived by a voice he knew not, thinking to throw <hi>Arnalta</hi> into the ſea, flung in another, who either for feare or affection aſſumed her name.</p>
               <p>I made them caſt the dead into the water, and then thought of repairing my Galley, which being brought into an ill plight made me reſolve to put in at the next Port. Coming thither, and dividing our booty among my Companions, counterfeiting my name and birth, with that beard which you ſaw me in firſt, I procured from the King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> a retiring Place, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and obtained my deſire. He being about to ſell this Palace, (falne to him by Confiſcation, belonging formerly to the Duke of <hi>Meſimoran,</hi> either through envy or deſert proclaimed Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and who upon an infamous Theater had terminated the Glories of his Life and Fame) I at any price got my ſelfe into the poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Celardo</hi> with a great curioſity deſired to know ſome more particulars of the Life of that Duke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oleandro</hi> replied: That the Actions of a Prince ſo great could not be penetrated into but with a thouſand uncertainties, agreeing to the opinion of him that ſhould deliver them. That ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (though we be not concerned in it) is dangerous. That great men would have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe things buried that might render them over, either to the pitty or ſcorne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169974:25"/>of others. That they ſuffer not themſelves to be talked of, either not to be liable to the cenſure of common diſcourſers, or that a reverence is due to him whoſe power is unlimited. To talke of Princes is not without danger: becauſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily truth is hatefull in great mens eares. I that live remote from State Affairs can but gueſs at uncertainties, which have no other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the opinion of the Vulgar, who oft argue of that they underſtand the leaſt. That judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be right given but by the effects. The wiſdome and the juſtice of ſo great a King pretends to no other end but the ſafetie of his own Life, the defence of his State, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Honour. Curioſitie the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed upon <hi>Celardo,</hi> by reaſon he heard theſe things ſo farre from his knowledge; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied by <hi>Oleandro</hi>'s promiſe, that at his better leiſure he ſhould participate of all he knew in it; he hearkned to the end of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Relation. He therefore proceeded.</p>
               <p>Here I lived enjoying the deliciouſneſs of the ſcituation, the fertilitie of the fields, the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of the Aire, and accounted at a great ſhelter to my misfortunes after ſo many yeares of miſeries once againe to enjoy my ſelfe in deſpite of Deſtiny. The ambitions for my Kingdome, ſpent in the courſe of ſo many infelicities, had loſt their appetite in tormenting me. Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating my mind to my preſent Fortune, far from me I caſt all thoſe imaginations that might mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt me. A Kingdome, although ſo deſired by all,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169974:25"/>renders Princes as unhappy, as ſervitude is often unſupportable to Subjects. The fruition of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie depends not in ruling over others, but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding our ſelves. The regulating our own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is that which can only make a man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. My Siſter <hi>Arnalta</hi> had been able to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my deliberations, if, wearie with the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the world, ſhe had not accommodated her heart to my reſolutions. I now thought my ſelfe truly hid from the eyes of Fate, far from the negotiations of Court, and from thoſe ambitions that are accuſtomed to provoke furies. Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelfe with this ſhadow of Felicity, I was certified that ſome had laid ſnares to entrap my life. If the duty I owed to my birth, and the generouſneſs of my heart had been capable of Cowardize, I ſweare to you <hi>Celardo</hi> by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligements I owe you, I had by my own death ſacrificed my ſelfe to their hatred who deſired it. I cannot imagine to my underſtanding a greater misfortune than to live in a continuall feare of enemies and not know them.</p>
               <p>One day I diſcovere their Plots, and knew the Traitours; They were ſent by the uſurpers of my Kingdome, with promiſes of great reward if they could make me away. They did not think their Reign ſure while I lived; and feared me, although they underſtood that I had not an intention to offend them. I remained aſtoniſhed that theſe impious men had not ſatiated their barbarous Natures in the uſurpation of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but that they alſo deſired with my bloud
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169974:26"/>to ſecure their tyrannie. Being grown therefore jealous of my ſelfe, I was alwaies afraid of being betrayed, whereupon I could not enjoy that quiet my heart deſired. To mock ſometimes, either my own feare, or their treaſons, I make uſe of that counterfeit haire, which conceales me even from thoſe that daily ſee me. I do not this becauſe I feare to die, but that my enemies ſhould not triumph in my death. I hold him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to live who knows not how to value and defend his life. He had not here made an end of his Diſcourſe, but that he was advertized the Count of <hi>Salinera</hi> had Commiſſion to ſpeake with him by his Majeſties appointment; with ſome alteration he aroſe from his ſeat, and ſaid to <hi>Celardo,</hi> That this was another wheele of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that his heart foretold him ſome evill. That he was not uſed to receive ſuch viſits, the rather becauſe the Count was one of the chiefe of his Majeſties Privie Councell. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took his leave, he went to meet him, leaving <hi>Celardo</hi> troubled with his ordinary Paſſions.</p>
               <p>The ſleep of the Princeſs was ſhort, becauſe her mind, oppreſſed and diſquieted by ſo many miſeries, would not allow her body to make any truce with repoſe. As ſhe opened her eyes ſhe ſpied an extreame handſome Ladie, that ſtood in an amaze, either at her habite, her beauty, or her unexpected arrivall there, and that could not be ſatisfied with thinking of her. The Princeſs, ſuppoſing her to bee ſome Goddeſs, would have caſt her ſelfe at her feet, beſeeching her
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169974:26"/>pardon for entring into that Temple. She ſaid, there was no Law that preſcribed rules to feare, and that neceſſity excuſes any boldneſs. The Courteſies of that Lady, which ſtrove in her Rock to equalize her beauty, conſented not that ſhe ſhould touch the ground with her knee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to proceed in Apologies, but ſaid, I was, faire Lady, about preventing your Adoration with mine, becauſe I could not imagine ſuch beauties were in Goddeſſes, neither to any but the Gods the entrance of this Cave known. I am a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo much the more aſcertained of it, becauſe I am daily ſubjected to thoſe paſſions which have no juriſdiction but in humane breaſts. The comelineſs of your face, the ſtrangeneſſe of your habit, and to ſee you in a place where the light comes not but by ſtealth, make me more curious than <hi>I</hi> ought. <hi>I</hi> beſeech you therefore informe me what Fortune hath made me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſo great a Gueſt, and what tearmes <hi>I</hi> am to uſe (your merit being known) to ſerve you. <hi>I</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Princeſs) implore from your gentleneſs nothing but ſome meane ſhelter to my miſeries. The which at preſent to relate to you would but encreaſe your trouble, becauſe they cannot be repreſented but with horrour, being ſo tragicall. And although your benignitie ſhould vouchſafe me attention, wearineſs and hunger ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs me, that <hi>I</hi> cannot thinke my ſelfe fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The Lady ſuffered her not to go on, but retiring aſide gave ſome orders, and returned ſpeedily to the Princeſs; from whom (not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169974:27"/>able to containe thoſe paſſions that tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her heart) ſhe deſired to know of whom ſhe had learned the Entrance into the Grott. She ſcarce underſtood ſhe had light upon it by chance, and had after ſhut it up againe very faſt with the bolt, but as a preſage of ſome ill towards her, loſing her colour, at the ſame inſtant, both her voice and ſpirits failed her. At laſt enforcing her ſelfe, and willing to ſuppreſs that griefe which oppreſſed her mind, ſhe ſaid to the Princeſſe, That our firſt motions are within us without our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that not a little to yield to the violences of Paſſion, is the effect either of ſtupiditie, or folly. And that our humane nature is too fraile.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Princeſſe, ignorant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of the cauſe of that alteration, run over all her thoughts, and could not imagine what to reſolve, when by an earneſt courteſie ſhe was led into one of thoſe Chambers which make a Crowne to the Court. It was adorned with moſt rich Furniture, beſeeming their Greatneſſe that frequented the place. There was Gold ſo ſeene as not waſted profuſely, but contemned. The Roofe was all chequered with the coſtlieſt jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which to the life repreſented the ſtories of fabulous Antiquity. The Pavement was alſo of the ſame work, compoſed of ſome ſtones, that like Looking-Glaſſes reflected the Image of whoſoever looked on it. The Princeſſe was full of wonder at two things: That this habitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ground was ſo lightſome, and that moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and time had not decaied thoſe Pictures, nor
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169974:27"/>periſhed thoſe Arches, which ſeemed all as freſh as if the Artificer had newly finiſhed them.</p>
               <p>Here being invited both by Neceſſity and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, ſhe was conſtrained to ſtrengthen her ſelfe with moſt delicate meates, and moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wines, that in a Moment were prepared by a venerable Matron: She afterwards laid her downe on a very coſtly bed, which for beautie and price yeelded nothing to the other Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that there were ſeen to be infinite. In bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farewell to that woman, ſhe ſaid to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, To morrow will be a fitter time to trouble you, I being very deſirous to know your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to meet with any occaſion to ſerve you. Some talke will be neceſſarie to deliberate about your ſatisfaction. Here you cannot ſtay long but with an incommoditie to your ſelf, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me: I this night will lie with you in ſtead of the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Belprato,</hi> if you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I may doe it without any perill to my ſelfe, or making him jealous who is my ſervant. The Princeſſe anſwered her with as much Courteſie, adding: That not for any thing in the world ſhe would occaſion her trouble, much leſs her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that as a Law ſhe will alwayes receive her Commands. Having leave in this manner, and being alone with the Dutcheſſe, after ſome complements of Excuſe and affection, ſhe entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, that until their eyes call'd them to repoſe, (to withdraw her minde from her miſerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that were ready not only to deprive
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169974:28"/>her of ſleep, but take away her life) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to her, whither Fortune had guided her, and who ſhe was that knew to oblige her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe knew her, with all other particulars that might ſatisfie her Curioſitie. The Dutcheſs was now laid down in another bed, neare that of the Princeſs, where after a little ſuſpence, ſhe thus anſwered:</p>
               <p>If I had not ſeen you Ladie in this Cave, where the Sunne communicating his light, yet dares not ſhine upon you, and if I did not know the heart of the Princeſs my Miſtriſs, that ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her affections, ſhe durſt commit her ſafetie into your hands, your Curioſitie and Entreaties, which I ſhould reverence in other matters as Commands, ſhould not prevaile with mee to ſpeak a word: Who cannot tell how to hold their peace, is unfit to ſerve Princes. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall duty of Faith, is to conceale thoſe Actions which Kings breathing forth, ſcarce truſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with: I, though a Woman, have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more obſerved this Axiome, the Dutie I owe others, and the regard I have to my owne ſafetie inciting me. Great ſecrets are not reveal'd but with great danger; and ordinarily, who ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies is betrai'd: You may pleaſe to take notice, that this Iſland is the amorous Kingdome of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus.</hi> Fame gives out, that this Cave was made by the command of <hi>Venus</hi> to conceale her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in; or by the firſt Kings, here to ſecure themſelves from Treacheries: It hath ſeven Mouthes, that all reach to the Sea; ſo farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169974:28"/>one from another as a man can ſee. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that under a pretence of Religion, Tillage is prohibited in this part of the Iſle, to take away occaſion from the Inhabitants of diſcovering theſe retiring places, or obſerving of any that ſhould come into them. All the Continent is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and to kill a wilde beaſt, or cut downe a Tree, a Capitall offence. After a long Circuit, the Entrance growing narrow, determines in a place call'd the ſecret Palace: The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeve that it took name from a Fountaine, which one drinking of, it repreſents in a dreame to their imaginations things to come; or, as I perſwade my ſelfe, by theſe private withdrawing places under ground, knowne onely to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and his Daughter, who for the moſt part here keeps his Court, by reaſon it is the moſt ſtrong and delicious part of this Iſland. In the remoteſt Chamber his Highnes Treaſure is kept, but in a place the leaſt obſerv'd, the Entrance being ſtopt with ſome boards, in ſuch wiſe doth cloſe, that they deceive both the eye and feeling. The eaſineſſe of removing them can be onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by thoſe who ſee them taken away. But I will not with tedious Circumſtances rob you of the Houres of your Repoſe:</p>
               <p>I will abbreviate my Diſcourſe, and onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thoſe things which are moſt worthy of your curioſity. I beſeech you added the Princeſs (I being newly arrived in theſe parts, and knowing a full Relation will come the welcommeſt to me,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169974:29"/>and my deſires, my ſorrowes not permitting me over-much ſleep) doe not ſo.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Hiſtory of <hi>Dianea, Diaſpe,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THe Dutcheſſe went on. The handſomeſt here are choſen Kings, and they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to continue the Kingdome in their Line, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Males or Females. Of the which if there be a faile, the chiefe of the Iſland meet about a new Election, which alwaies lights on him whom <hi>Venus</hi> is prodigall of her favours to. In King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> who now reignes, in whom the vertue of his mind contends with the comlineſs of his perſon, all our hopes are accompliſhed. The Acclamations and the Joyes of the people were not any whit defrauded by the proofs of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the goodneſſe of his Government, being of a complying diſpoſition to all, but inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wicked men, with a Majeſtick Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he hath gain'd himſelfe the good will of his enemies, and not onely the hearts of his Subjects. He was fear'd by his neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, belov'd by the Remote, and in briefe ador'd by all. The Devotions of the people were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in ſupplications to the mercie of the Gods, to eternize a ſtock ſo every way wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
               <p>By two wives he had no iſſue but one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Princeſſe <hi>Dianea</hi> my Miſtris, ſo call'd after her mothers name, who died in Child-bed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169974:29"/>of her. The more ſhe increaſed in yeares, the handſomer ſhe grew. This Sun, although but riſing, raviſhed the deſires of all eyes, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the moſt frozen mindes, and in the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt boſomes a tender affection: An eye cannot behold her without parting with an heart. I ſhould ſay more, if ſo noble conditions could be expoſed, and if you when you had ſeen her ſhould not believe her one of the moſt beautifull Ladies of the world. A thouſand have aim'd at her affection, and infinite is the number of them who have falne in love with her. This Paradiſe of perfection hath been deſired and beſeeched for of all worthy men. What cannot a beautie more then great, accompanyed with a vaſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for her Dowrie doe? They that knew not how to love any thing but themſelves, and their proper Intereſts, expreſſed themſelves moſt ambitious of her. Thoſe inſenſible ones, that could not be conquered by her Beauty, were inthral'd by the power of their owne Ambition. The wiſedome of his Majeſtie, which would get him a Sonne-in-law, and not an enemy, neither entertain'd, nor refuſed their offers. He inclin'd not to Kings, becauſe he would not diſmember <hi>Cyprus:</hi> And with his Subjects he diſdain'd, as a diminution of the Royall greatneſs: His neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes were not to his ſatisfaction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being blemiſhed with a thouſand vices, he would not at the ſame time endanger his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, his Daughter, and himſelfe. And of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote matches he abhorred the thought, as they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169974:30"/>that would carrie the Princeſſe with them, which would be a ſeparating of his Soule from his Body.</p>
               <p>Finally, his Majeſties mind fix'd on the Duke of <hi>Araone,</hi> the youngeſt Sonne of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> a Knight, (but for the deformity of his face) the moſt worthy of his times. His abode was then in the Court, and with the proofes of his valour he had to won upon the Kings affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that him he choſe to ally ſo neare to him as to make him his Sonne. There was no doubt that he ſhould diſmember the Crowne, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Princeſſe into a Remote Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt of a numerous Iſſue, and having the diſpoſing of nothing in his hands but his Horſe and Armes. The King acquainted the Princeſſe with his Reſolution, who was ready to die of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row when ſhe heard it. The reverence ſheow'd her Father, and the modeſty of her Sex, were not ſufficient to cloath her with ſo much wiſedome as to conceale the paſſions of her minde. To oppoſe her ſelfe to the deſires of her Father, was not the cuſtome of her will or heart: And how ſhould ſhe contradict him, who commanded as a Father, and would be obeyed as a King! But recovering her ſelfe, ſhe beſeeched his Majeſtie to give her ſome time, that ſhe might be able to diſpoſe of her ſelfe according to his Commands: She ſaid, that great Reſolutions ſhould not bee proſecuted without premeditation; that ſeeing ſhe was to oblige her ſelfe to ſo unequall a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, it was but reaſon that ſhe firſt ſhould
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169974:30"/>perſwade her minde to it: That marriages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, either by the Authority of thoſe that treat of them, or by their power that make them, are for the moſt part unhappy. She added other Reaſons; whereupon her Father allowed her ſix moneths time, not onely for her deliberation, but the conſummation of the Nuptials. How then the Princeſſe remain'd confus'd, they may imagine, whoſe Deſtinie it was ever to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to love.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Creet,</hi> under a feign'd name, at this time was entertain'd at the Court; in whom it appeared that Nature and Fortune had Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miz'd all the wonders of the World. In Arms he was invincible, ſingular for handſomneſſe, and in vertue without equals. It ſeemed that <hi>Jove, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> in that face had finiſhed their Greatneſſes. Whoever once beheld him, could never after forget him, he fixing indelibly ſuch rarities in his minde that obſerved him. He was Honoured and beloved by the King, and his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lords, who in him alone admired at thoſe perfections, which are to be wiſhed for in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Princeſſe in particular Conquered by ſo many wonders, affecting him above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preferred him above her ſelfe. She had not runne precipitally in theſe Reſolutions: for twice <hi>Diaſpe</hi> (for ſo he gave out his name) had ſaved her life: Once in the Lake <hi>Chiti,</hi> whither ſhee was carried by the unrulineſſe of her Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Another time at a courſing with Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds; for a Tigre ruſhing out of ſome Wood,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169974:31"/>that terrified and over-threw all the reſt a (with an admirable undauntedneſſe) was ſlaine by him. To theſe Obligations the Affection he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he bore her was adjoyned. For one day (after he had a thouſand times diſcovered his heart to me) he had the fortune to meet the Princeſſe alone in a Garden, where he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to tell her his Paſſions, to reveale his Boſome, and diſcover his Birth. He found her ſo diſpoſed, that the greateſt difficulty was to invent a meanes whereby to obtaine the Ends of their Amours.</p>
               <p>He would have ſtoln her away, but the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe conſented not to it, doubting ſhe might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her Father, the Kingdome, and her ſelfe. Such Examples were for her Reſtraint, the free opinion of the world having condemn'd them: and thoſe marriages to be unhappy which begin with the diſhonour of the people, and the griefe of ones Parents. To obtaine her by requeſt for his wife, was impoſſible, becauſe of the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hatred between the two Crownes. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo repleat with tenderneſſe, ought not to deliver his onely one daughter into the hands of one of his greateſt Enemies. To ſubject the Crowne to a Prince, who ſhould not make his abode in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was to reduce that Kingdome into a Province, an inſupportable thing to this People. Notwithſtanding to continue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intangled in theſe feares, became a great moleſtation to them both: becauſe with Lovers thoſe things cannot be long endured, that retard
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169974:31"/>the Atchievement of their deſires. <hi>Diaſpe</hi> grew almoſt wild at the Kings Reſolutions. He would deſtroy <hi>Armenia,</hi> and kill this new Pretender. Sometimes he reproved the Princeſſe of her little love, becauſe ſhe had ſubmitted her ſelfe to a ſimple command of her Fathers. That there was nothing more unconquerable than love, who knows not to deny, knows not how to affect. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to be obeyed in all things, ſaving thoſe that directly were oppoſite to ones owne heart.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he accuſed himſelfe of negligence, that with a powerfull Army ſhould have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the deſignes and hopes of all. Princes would not be regulated but by a preſent feare. And in their Conſultations any Reſolution would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome that was beſieged by a multitude of Souldiers. Sometimes he complained of the King, that with an obſtinate Command would make deſperate his Daughters affections, ſo much the more becauſe. ſhe was his only one, and heire of ſuch a Kingdome. They proceed with little diſcretion that by their odde humours enforce maids to deſperation; Princeſſes (ſaith he) ought then in their Marriages to preferre their Fathers before their own ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction! That which is not denied to the baſeſt woman of the world ſhall not be permitted them who are borne to rule! If your Father to pleaſe himſelfe cares not to diſpleaſe you, why will you encounter death rather than contradict the Commands of your Father? Is there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance an Equality between <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia!</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:169974:32"/>Between the power of a King and that of a private perſon: who takes you, not ſo much to enjoy you as a wife, but becauſe he ſees you a Queene. The Princeſſe anſwered not but with teares, and repoſed all her defences, and all her reaſons in lamentations. Finallie they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in great Evils violent Remedies are the ſafeſt; That too much zeale, and too much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie were as prejudiciall as an exceſſe of feare, or a raſh reſolution. That he therefore ſhould ſend into <hi>Creete</hi> to his Father to raiſe ſpeedily a very ſtrong Armie, that he might be enabled to defend his pretentions by the Sword. That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the will of heaven was interpoſed to theſe Negotiations, that the Princeſſe ſhould eſcape thorough this Cave to the ſea ſide, where before her flight was diſcovered they might be farre cuough from the juriſdiction of <hi>Cyprus. Diaspe</hi> the better to have proſecuted this buſineſs would have returned thither in perſon, but the Princeſſe would not ſuffer him, foreſeeing as it were in her ſelfe ſome miſchiefe. I being preſent, the Faith of Matrimony they plighted betweene them, invoking all the Imprecations of the Gods upon the Failers, vowing to meet death a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times before they would beſtow their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon others. Many daies before then the Promiſe of Marriage had paſſed between them, but now only authenticated by my being by, and ſolemnized by the teſtimony of the Gods.</p>
               <p>In the meane while all the City was a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to entertaine the new Prince, who was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169974:32"/>gone into <hi>Armenia</hi> to his Father, to deſire Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours and Attendants that ſhould aſſiſt with ſtate at his Nuptials. Arches were erected, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſuſes raiſed, repreſenting the Glories of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> and <hi>Armenia.</hi> All were a preparing Armes and Horſes to flatter the Genius of the Princes, and not to ſhew themſelves inferiour to others. The Count of <hi>Cittera,</hi> a young man of a very great valour, and an extraordinary expectation, was Admirall of the Sea. He had in him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of faults, but he ſo well knew how to diſguiſe them, that if they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for vertues, they were not believed as vices. The King had raiſed him to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honour for his Fathers deſerts, who was the chiefe of his Councell of State. He managed it well enough, becauſe, aſpiring to high things, he would not ſhew himſelfe unworthy. Percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the favour of the People, the affection of the Souldiers, and the Kingdome without a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Males, he imagined by marrying with the Princeſſe to advance himſelfe to the Royall Throne, he durſt not open his mouth of it to his Father; for knowing him of an incontaminated goodneſſe, he would not have prevented him with chaſtiſement, at leaſt have hindred him in his waies. He aſſayed the mind of the Princeſs with ſignes of an affection not ordinary; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelfe deſpiſed, he turned his thoughts upon new deſignes. He endeavoured to procure to himſelfe the good wils of the Great Ones with feaſts and banquets; He obliged the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169974:33"/>with liberty and gifts. The Vulgar were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with a plenty of all things that he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, and with nouriſhing them in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In briefe, he did not neglect any of thoſe Arts which might facilitate his tyranny. The Nuptials of the Princeſs with the <hi>Armenian</hi> interpoſed the courſe of his pretentions, whereupon he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his mind to a wickedneſſe more execrable. In concluſion, when a perfidious mind is diſpoſed to miſchiefe, all the ſtops in the world are not availeable ſufficiently to ſtay it.</p>
               <p>The Count had been twice in <hi>Thracia,</hi> the firſt time with his Father about State Affaires. The other time alone, to congratulate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the new King to the Crown of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. <hi>Amuritte</hi> (for ſo the King was called) had many times been in <hi>Cyprus</hi> when his Fathers Palace was infeſted by the malice of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks. He appeared to the Count as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inſtrument to perfectionate his hopes. He advertized the <hi>Thracian,</hi> by a Meſſenger diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on purpoſe, That the Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> at the leaſt beck of his Majeſty was ready to fall into his hands; That the People were ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi>'s Government, the Commonalty grown Cowards, the Forts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence, the Souldiers under him, the Arms in his Command, the Seas and Ports in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. That he was not provoked to this by any other end, but that he would not obey a King who was a ſtranger, deformed in mind and in body. That ſeeing the Kingdom muſt be altered,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169974:33"/>he did rather chooſe to make gift of it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, a Prince of whoſe greatneſſe he had made experiment, as alſo of his vertues, then to give obedience to a Man who came to the Throne before he had learnt the Rules to governe by. That if his Majeſtie was pleaſed with the offer, and this reſolution of his heart, he would requeſt nothing for his ſervice but the Princeſſe to wife, with the Kingdome in dowry; and that he and his Succeſſours would hold it of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and pay them homage with a very great tribute. He added, that to raiſe a great Army, would, without any benefit to himſelfe, beget ſuſpicion in his confining Princes. That in the ſuddenneſs of this conſiſted the accompliſhment of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, he now needing but to ſteale it, and not to fight for it. That only two Gallies would be more than enow, they being certaine to find no reſiſtance. That he might diſguiſe the cauſe of his Arrivall, with a pretence either of friendſhip, or of chance. He omitted not other particulars, and other inſtructions, which might render him the more eaſie to conſent to him. Ill men never want meanes to give effect to their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>One Morning with two Gallies, becoming the merit of his Greatneſſe, the King of the <hi>Thracians</hi> appeared in the Port of <hi>Arſinoe.</hi> The King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> with ſome amazement received newes of the Arrivall of this Prince, although the deſigne never fell within his thoughts. Order was given to the Admirall (as one beſt known
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169974:34"/>to the <hi>Thracian</hi>) to receive him. Their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (though on a ſudden) was moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, the Horſe innumerable, and the Traine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. The King came to Land with but fifty of the moſt Noble, and the moſt couragious youths of <hi>Thace;</hi> with a great deale of affection he welcomed thoſe that came to him by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his Majeſty, to whom he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thanks for the honours he received of them. His Entertainment was at the Charges of the Republick. But after three daies he would not permit it, ſaying, he had given way to that as a ſigne of his liberty, which was prepared for his Honour. The day after he was waited on to the King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> who received him at the foot of the Staires. There he uſed ſuch words, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſuch things as would have beguiled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it ſelfe. Among other things he ſaid, He was come to adore that Sun, that not ſcorning his misfortunes (by a benigne influence of it) had bleſſed him with proſperity; That he rejoyced at the Matrimony of the Princeſſe with the Prince of <hi>Armenia;</hi> adding, that he could not containe himſelfe for joy in ſeeing the Age of ſo worthy a King extended (by it) to eternity; but (ſaid he) it was never ſubject to yeares, he (for his wiſdome) being never young. That he was above Fortune, who in deſpite of it knew to chooſe himſelfe ſo deſerving a Son. That the principall cauſe of his comming was to ſerve his Majeſty in thoſe Feaſts, which Fame (and not without good reaſon) had ſpread through the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169974:34"/>greateſt part of the world. And that he came not as a King, but as an Adventurer; the merits of the two Princes being ſuch as would compell any body to any diſguiſe to do them ſervice. He omitted not other particulars, expreſſed with ſo much Affection, that Adulation, and Diſſembling won him Affection, and an high welcome. After ſome returne of thanks, King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> anſwered him, That he the rather deſired to be eternized in thoſe Nuptials of his Daughter, becauſe they would report to his Poſterity the Obligations which he owed to the Love of ſo great a King. That he received the honour of this viſit, as an Act proper to the King of the <hi>Thracians:</hi> For he knew nothing in himſelfe worthy to deſerve ſuch Graces but the ardent affection he bore him.</p>
               <p>Theſe Complements being paſt, they went both of them to the Princeſs. And it was obſerved, that the <hi>Thracian</hi> ſtood in amaze at her beauty, not believed ſuch by him before, having ſeen her only when ſhe was a Child. There after ſome expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how welcome he was, he told her his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to wait on her at her Wedding, and then jeſted with her at the ſtay of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelfe to be her Knight untill his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. The Princeſſe replied to all with ſo much expreſſion of kindneſſe and gentleneſſe, that her words (conquering his reſiſtance) betraied his heart. Finally, after they were parted, the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> remained no leſſe ſatisfied at the Kings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, than he was aſtoniſhed at the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169974:35"/>of his Daughter. From day to day they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to oblige themſelves with ſo high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that their Subjects flatterers of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſpoſition feaſted them perpetually now in the City now upon the Galleys, nor neglected any thing that might be a ſigne of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and good will.</p>
               <p>The Admirall in the meane while proſecuted his plot with ſuch circumſpection, that there was not any body that ſuſpected him. One day (while the <hi>Thracian</hi> underſtanding the <hi>Armcuian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces arrivall with foure Galleys was neare;) fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome ſtop ſhould fall betweene him and his hopes, he gave the laſt aſſay unto his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He invited King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> the Princeſs, and ſome of the Court to a Fiſhing, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be made according to the Cuſtome of his Countrey. He had been other times on the Sea with his Majeſty, whereupon there was not any that doubted of his Faith; And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he had diſpoſed for this buſineſſe but one only Galley, leaving his other in the Port, and having with a ſpecious Apparance divided his men into ſmall Barkes, brought from our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenall. His Majeſty accepted of the invitation, and one morning betimes went aboord the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, accompanied with ſome few of his Councel, and the Princeſs <hi>Dianea,</hi> that came againſt her will (her feigning her ſelfe indiſpoſed prevailing not) with ſixe Damſels, and he who never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned her. There would alſo have come many Knights belonging to the Court, but the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169974:35"/>
                  <hi>Thracian</hi> diſſembling, and ſaying all places were fill'd, would not ſuffer any to enter but a few, and they all either Friends, or of the Counts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie.</p>
               <p>We were gone ten miles into the Sea, when he began the Fiſhing. It was truely a Paſtime of much wonder, and worthy to be obſerved. Some Barques went from us about a mile, the which after a long Compaſs, returned with ſuch whoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, that it ſeemed they would deafen the Seas. They made that all the Fiſh was drawne together to the Poop of the Galley, where it was often taken by Nets ordered for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Without doubt the ſight was ſingular, the Fiſhes being infinite for number, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie bigneſs. There were ſome ſeene, that to eſcape the Nets, leap'd up ſo high, as if they had wings. Other by crooked windings endeavoured to have loos'd themſelves out of the Nets: Many bold of their owne greatneſs try'd to break the ſnares that impriſon'd them: many leapt into the Barks, and finally all, either fearing to be took, or death, ſcudding about after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand manner of wayes, very much pleas'd the eyes of the Beholders. <hi>Dianea</hi> onely, and I, could take no pleaſure in theſe paſtimes, either for griefe of theſe Nuptials, or that our hearts preſaged to us the ill that was at hand. The <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> beſtowed a moſt ſumptuous Banquet on us, becauſe returning to Dinner ſhould not break off the Fiſhing.</p>
               <p>Two houres before night, the other Galley
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169974:36"/>came in ſight, rowing ſoftly upon the Sea. It was ſcarce perceived, where the <hi>Thracian</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding away the Barks, departed from us, as if he would give order it ſhould returne. In the meane while many armed Knights enter upon the upper Deck of ours, and before any body could lay hand to his ſword, we were all made Priſoners. King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> finding they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trai'd, more grieved at his Daughters Captivity then his owne Misfortune, was ready to dye for ſorrow: Covering notwithſtanding his griefe with that wiſedome which rendred him ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar among Princes, he neither ſpoke, nor did things unbecomming his greatneſs. He told thoſe Knights, that it diſpleaſed him that the Glories of <hi>Thracia</hi> ſhould be contaminated with Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries and Treaſons; and that a Priſon could not bring him ſo much trouble as to ſee in ſo great a King a minde ſo vile, and baſeneſſe ſo exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable. He comforted the Princeſſe, who was oppreſſed with ſo violent a paſſion, that ſhe ſeemed ſtupifyed with ſorrow. I and the other Ladies fill'd heaven without cries, and with ſo many Imprecations againſt the <hi>Thracians,</hi> that I wonder how they had the patience to deſpiſe them. By this time <hi>Amuritto</hi> came to viſit us, and ſhewing that hee tooke great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at our ſadneſſe, he ſaid to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> it pierces my ſoul to have done any thing that might occaſion your Sorrow: I had not condeſcended to this for any thing, but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169974:36"/>for the Affection I beare to the Reputation of your perſon, and to the good of your Kingdom. This that hath an appearance of ill, ſhall not determine but in well, if your Majeſtie will have a regard to the End and not the Beginning. Do not believe that the <hi>Thracians</hi> would rob from their Victories, nor that <hi>Amuritte</hi> intends to blemiſh his glories with Treaſon, which in a little while I hope to ſee you undeceived; and though yet the Remedie hath appeared ſharp to you, for all that, many times it is neceſſary to make uſe of fire, and from mortall Inſtruments to recover our health. I beſeech your Majeſty to ſuſpend your Anſwer and Complaints untill after Supper; And ſo taking him by the hand, he enforced him with a courteous violence to come to the Tables, which were now made ready. He did the ſame to the Princeſſe, comforting her with words full of courteſie and affection. We Ladies follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, with all thoſe that belonged to the King; Being ſoon come upon the Deck, we ſaw our Admirall, the Count of <hi>Cithera.</hi> Not knowing his Treaſon we remained full of admiration, eſpecially the King, who knew he had left him in the Arſenell, with Commiſſion to have a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in readines, more for State Policie then ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of any Treaſon.</p>
               <p>The Purification, according to the Cuſtome of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> being a preparing, places were appointed for all: With a moſt ſoft Scarfe they hood-wink'd the eyes of all; and after covered the heads of all that were invited with very fine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169974:37"/>cloth of gold, while one of their Prieſts mutter'd ſome prayers, there was brought every body a a Baſon to purifie their hands in. This being paſt, the Feaſt began. Their eyes were all ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, when they ſaw the Count of <hi>Cithera</hi> ſtrangled, and laid at length on the floore. The Father of the Count who ſate neare his Majeſty, could not bridle in the violences of Love and Anger, which tormented his heart: Whilſt the reſt aſtoniſhed knew not what to doe, but gaze on one another, he (ariſing from his ſeat, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to refraine from teares, which whether he would or not, agreed with his tongue to eaſe his griefe) ſaid to <hi>Amuritte:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truely ſo execrable Suppers where bloud is mix'd, Wine can belong to none but the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> If cruell man thou didſt only deſire my ſons Death, why doſt thou kill the Father with ſo mortall an Object, who hath no other fault in thy hatred, but thy owne Furie? I implore the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of the Gods, that they let not paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, Hoſpitality violated, Virgins ſtolne, ſo curſed an Ingratitude, and ſo unjuſt Murthers. The exceſſes of his Paſſion had not ſtopt here, if the violence of his griefe had not buried his words in his mouth. Good old man, replyed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muritte,</hi> for the reſpect I beare to the Majeſty of King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> and to the Affection of a Father, I pardon the Errours of your tongue. If your Senſes tyrannized not over your Reaſon, I would make you learne what it is to offend the Juſtice of Kings. So having ſaid, he produced the Counts
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169974:37"/>Letters, (and the Meſſenger hee had ſent him comming in, whom in <hi>Cyprus</hi> hee had entertained) he made the Treaſon appear plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them all. Afterwards turning to King <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſileo,</hi> he added: For two things I may be blamed; The firſt, that I have made the puniſhment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Diſcoverie of the fault; The other, that I took on me to doe that Juſtice that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to you: yet I have done them both with a great Foundation of Reaſon. Firſt, to terrifie Traitors from attempting upon the perſon of their owne Princes; and ſecondly, to free you from the hatred of the dead mans kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, more eſpecially his Father, who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, with much difficulty believed his Sonne guilty. But old friend be ſatisfied, that I could not offer up to the gods a greater Sacrifice then the puniſhment of this wicked man, who for his Ambition of Rule, hath in his Treaſon to others betrai'd himſelfe. The other Acceſſaries, which are of ſome number, I remit them to your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Give me leave onely to put your in minde, that forgiveneſſe is a noble property of Kings: And that the taking away the heads of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy ought to be attributed to the gods as a great Favour, and accounted to a Kingdome as a great Felicity. For what remaines, when the winde will permit, I will conduct your Majeſty into <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> where I will pretend to no other reward then the love and thanks of ſo great a King.</p>
               <p>Here he ſtaied, fixing his eyes upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169974:38"/>who after a little Recollection ſaid thus: King <hi>Amuritte,</hi> Thoſe things which Fortune to day hath preſented unto me, have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo amazed me, that I know not whether I live or dreame. The zeale of your affection, (with which preventing my Intereſts, hath made you condiſcend to ſo great Deliberations) ſhall be alwayes reverenced by me, according to the multitude of my obligations. I will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the candour of your friendſhip, the generouſneſs of your Spirit, the worthineſſe of your Minde, and the nobleneſſe of your Birth; The Conſervation of my Kingdome, the Honour of my Daughter, and preſervation of my Selfe. His Majeſty had not ſtopped here, if the Father of the Admirall had not interrupted him with ſaying: Pardon me (O King) that if for the griefe I feele I cannot containe my ſelfe within the Duties I owe to the Eminencies of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the humbleneſſe of my condition. The Faults of the Count of <hi>Cithera,</hi> (whom I will not call Sonne, to encreaſe my ſorrow) if they are ſuch as they are reported, deſerve your anger even to all his kindred. If the gods had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they had been the ſlanders of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to precipitate him from the favours of your Majeſty, I ſhould have become a Supplicant to you for Juſtice, although I ſhould not have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it. It will be an Adjunct to your glories, (Magnanimous King) to exerciſe your pietie upon the Aſhes of the dead, and that your huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be moved with Carkaſſes in their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169974:38"/>In theſe Doubts of my Sons loyalty, and my Princes favour I cannot live. I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Fortune ſo much power over me: If ever (Sir) the candidneſs of my thoughts, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my actions, the ingenuity of my faſhion, and the freedome of my Conſults have aim'd at any thing then the Reputation of your Majeſty, the Preſervation of your Poſterity, the honour of your Crowne, and the welfare of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I invoke all the Gods, that the ſtormes of their indignation may fall upon my head, and that they never grant Repoſe to my ſoule in the <hi>Elizian</hi> happy fields.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt words were ſcarce underſtood, when ſtabbing himſelfe twice in the breaſt, hee dyed before he could be ſuccoured. The <hi>Thracian</hi> ſuddenly commanded the dead bodies ſhould be removed, which was done with ſo great a reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all, that the leaſt expreſſion was Tears. It was impoſſible that any body ſhould eate, wherfore the Tables being took away, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us into the Keel; for now a Tempeſt ſo ſuddenly came on us, that it gave us not time to know our danger. It was repleat with darkneſs ſo, that it ſeemed the Gods had deprived us of the Beames of the Celeſtiall Luminaries, that the waters might ſwallow us. It ſceemed that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven would ſmother the ſea, and that it would make warre againſt the Starres. The Windes concurring with the Waves, raiſed mountaines and Precipices, Thunder, and Lightning, dazling our ſight, and taking away our hearing, took
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169974:39"/>away all Command and Obedience. The cries of the Mariners and Pilots to keep the Rowers to their Duty, they heard ſo imperfectly, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of remedying the Danger, they produced more Confuſion, and augmented fear. The Oars being too weake to contend with the violence of the Waves, were ſhivered into a thouſand pieces; ſo alſo were their Cords and Tacklings. The <hi>Thracians</hi> Diligences, who with a brave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſs now exhorted, now promiſed, now threatned, ſhewing at one time both the Office of a Mariner, and a King, delay'd our being caſt away, which every moment we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>By one of his Prieſts he was advertized, that the Sea-gods were offended, when dead bodies are carried aboard; the Genius of the Waters not enduring it: That this Piety might be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the ſhore, collecting their Ghoſts into one place by devout Funeralls. The <hi>Thracian</hi> durſt not oppoſe this superſtition or Religion of the Mariners: Therefore the bodies of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall and his Father, being throwne among the Waves, the furie of the Tempeſt was ſuddenly appeas'd, we being driven far from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhores of <hi>Africk.</hi> He gave command to his, that the Dammages of their paſt Fortune ſhould be repair'd with all diligence; that with their more ſecurity they might make their return to <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards hee came to King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> and (ſome talke of the paſt danger being ended) he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169974:39"/>ſaid. There is not any thing Father, and Friend that more alters our deliberations than the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Fortune. All our propoſals, deſigns, and all our promiſes, are loſt, vaniſhed, and retracted, when the reaſons that firſt occaſioned them are removed or altered; you promiſed the Princeſſe <hi>Dianea</hi> to the youngeſt Son of the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> when others were not Sutors for her, and when your own Intereſts in your State were not ſo as they are at preſent. Now when I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered you from an enemy, the more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe hard to be diſcovered, and that all things of your Kingdome are altered, why may you not with honour releaſe your ſelfe from your promiſe? I will not inſiſt upon (to perſwade you) the greatneſſe of my States, the ſtrength of my Armies, the valour of my People, becauſe King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi>'s mind cannot be tempted by hopes. So having ſpoke he did not manifeſt by any ſigne that he had him in his power, to demonſtrate that with all candidneſſe he treated of this Match, or elſe with a cunningneſs, ſeeming to ſlight it, to raiſe a greater opinion of him in the King.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty, having a regard to his preſent condition, made uſe of ſuch words as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, expreſſing that he had a great deſire to pleaſe him. He added afterwards, you propound to me friend a match to be wiſhed for, when it was in my power to effect it, who would not (though with much trouble) procure an alliance with <hi>Amuritte,</hi> and <hi>Thracia?</hi> Who would not endeavour to renew himſelfe, in a young man ſo
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169974:40"/>valiant, and in a King ſo great? Yet know that to retract my word given to a King with the Conſent of my Councell, and to the ſatisfaction of my Subjects is not in my power. I propoſe not here the caſe of my reputation, and the honour of my promiſes. All that is lawfull which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>Amuritte;</hi> I reflect only upon the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a remedy, and upon the dangers that may ſucceed it. The King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who is ſo neare to my Dominions, would without doubt perceive himſelfe injured by this offence. How will my Subjects ſuffer my excuſes, when they find themſelves wronged by them? But if I could do it, neither my people, Councell, nor the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> againſt it, my Daughters conſent is to be got, whom I have ever left to her owne choiſe in theſe Affaires of Matrimony. Minds are not born Subjects, nor ſhould they be joyned by violence. If this is obſerved among private perſons, how much rather ought it with Kings, and thoſe that are to ſucceed in Kingdomes?</p>
               <p>He proceeded, when <hi>Amuritte</hi> was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that foure Galleys drew neare them, carried thither by the late Tempeſt. And that, by as much as could be diſcerned at ſuch a diſtance, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours belonged to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> The <hi>Thracian</hi> rejoyced at this encounter, wherein he ſhould have occaſion to kill his enemy; and preſently gave command to all his to arme with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, making proviſion of burning lime, pitch, and other artificiall fires to dammage his enemies with. The Galleys approaching, while the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:169974:40"/>who were more in number, demanded the obedience accuſtomary to the Sea; the <hi>Thracian</hi> took hold of this occaſion, and charged them before they thought they could be aſſaulted. In this firſt encounter it was eaſie for him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and rout two Galleys, yet torne and ſhaken by the Sea, and not ſuſpecting ſuch a matter. But he found greater reſiſtance in the other two, the <hi>Infante</hi> being there with the moſt part of the Nobility of <hi>Armenia,</hi> coming to waite on the Prince, allured by the Applauſes of theſe Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. They grapled together, and began one of the fierceſt fights that to the memory of man was ever ſeene on thoſe Seas. The ſlaine were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the drowned infinite, and the wounded without number. The Archers ſhot not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in vaine, and many times ſlew their friends when they aimed at their enemies. The <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> who now grew doubtfull of the victory, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſelected a brave company of his valianteſt men, by plaine force entered the <hi>Armenians</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Galley. There, although he was wounded by a thouſand ſtrokes, and loſt bloud from as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounds, he ſingled out the <hi>Infante,</hi> who with a great courage defended himſelfe. They collected all their ſtrength in this fight, their men alſo becomming obſtinate in the defence of their Princes. The <hi>Thracian,</hi> though he cloſed with the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the other for a while equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood him. At laſt they both fell; The <hi>Thracian</hi> had the better Fortune in the fall, for being uppermoſt he had time to ſtrike the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:169974:41"/>in the Groine with a Dagger, and in the Face with two mortall wounds. Afterwards, all beſmeared with bloud, in deſpite of his enemies, well defended by his own, more ready in fight, and better prepared for it, to the aſtoniſhment of all that ſaw him, he leapt into his own Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. Then he made many fire-bals to be thrown among them, ſo ſpeedily, that the <hi>Armenians</hi> loſing all courage with the <hi>Infante's</hi> death, and terrified with their own danger, ſuffered them to burne. This in a moment increaſed ſo faſt, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the wind, that if the <hi>Thracians</hi> had been ſlow in getting far enough off, they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what they intended only for others, and had eaſily been deſtroyed by their own fires.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Armenian</hi> Galleys were conſumed in a moment, notwithſtanding any command or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the chiefe Knights could uſe to prevent it. Thoſe that blesſed their good fortune, for having leapt into the Sea without their Armes were ſeen miſerably to periſh either by ſmoake, or to be drown'd in the water. The groans of thoſe that languiſhed between their wounds, the waves, and the fire, provoked no pity in the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the <hi>Thracian,</hi> who feeling the ſmart of his own hurts was aſſiſting to the utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Armenians.</hi> Of whom there was not any that eſcaped from the fire or ſea to carry the report of ſo great a loſs. Many that by ſwiming came cloſe to our Galley were moſt barbarouſly ſhot, at one time dying (unhappy as they were) two deaths.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:169974:41"/>
               <p>The <hi>Thracian</hi> joyfull of this victory, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now there could not be any thing to hinder his marriage with the Princeſs, or ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him of the Crown of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> felt not the paine of his wounds, although very conſiderable. Being requeſted by his to be dreſsed, he retired, making us partakers of his ſucceſs. King <hi>Vaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo,</hi> though he received much ſorrow at it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, enquiring of his health, expreſſing himſelfe ſollicitous for it. Atteſtations of great men are ordinarily diſguiſed according to their proper intereſts. The Princeſs and I had by it a mortified conſolation, both their lives being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hatefull to us. <hi>Dianea</hi> then complained of Fortune, that ever and anon prepared dangers for her. But our ſorrow continued not long, for we were told that a Galley purſued us, rowed at full ſpeed. <hi>Amuritte</hi> underſtanding that it was only one Galley, ſeemed to ſlight it. On the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den we imagined any thing but the truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being but one it delayed us ſometimes in doubt. But becauſe the mind eaſily thinks what it deſires, we were of opinion they were more in number, and that this, either to diſcover the Sea, or to get ſome advantage, had ſeparated from the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diaſpe</hi> the Prince of <hi>Creete</hi> was in it, who having been invited to the Fiſhing, feigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſick, either becauſe his mind preſaged ſome evill, or that he would not mixe in an action with the greateſt enemy he had. This day he had not ſtirred abroad, but that the houre being
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169974:42"/>come that they ſhould neceſſarily returne, he went to the Port to meet them. There not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Admirall nor any of his ſervants, and underſtanding that the <hi>Thracians</hi> that were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into little Veſſels were all alſo gone, he ſuddenly apprehended that there was ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery Enquiring of many his opinion was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed, when he was aſcertained that the Admirall went thence with the <hi>Thracians.</hi> He ſtood not long reſolving, but tooke into the Admirall Galley the ableſt Rowers out of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and five hundred of the valianteſt, and the moſt truſty Souldiers, publiſhing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and with the chiefe of the Courtiers then put to Sea. He likewiſe left order that the other Galleys ſhould follow him with more Forces, and with all ſpeed that was poſſible.</p>
               <p>He was ſcarce got out of the Channell of <hi>Gavata,</hi> and left <hi>Cyprus</hi> on this ſide, when he was aſſaulted by a Tempeſt. But he received little harmeby it, His Galley being an extreame good one, well furniſhed with Slaves and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiners, ſo that deſpite of the waves and the winds they followed their Voyage. In coaſting the Promontorie of <hi>Acerauno</hi> he was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they diſcovered two Galleys, which if they lay not at Anchor they made then no haſte. Glad of this, he gave command, the Ghinge, and Souldiers ſhould eate, putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Armes. He came upon the <hi>Thracians</hi> who had not time to prepare themſelves for fight, ſlighting it, becauſe it was but one, or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169974:42"/>not ſuſpecting it for an enemy.</p>
               <p>Their Admirall was preſently charged, for their other would make no defence, being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to ſwim, much leſſe to fight. The <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> making weake reſiſtance, <hi>Diaſpe</hi> entred the Galley, making that ſlanghter which their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe deſerved. <hi>Amuritte,</hi> being certified his Galley was taken, ran to the ſuccour of his, deſpite of the Phyſitians, who proteſted againſt his life. He encouraged the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and for a while heartned them to fight. But they being unable to reſiſt ſo great a multitude, fell down all either dead, or to render themſelves Priſoners. He only obſtinate in fight, after having ſhewne many ſignes of an extraordinary valour, fell breathing out his ſoule from a mighty wound <hi>Diaſpe</hi> had given him in the Breaſt. Such was the end of <hi>Amuritte</hi> the King of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> worthy truly for his many vertues of a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable death, if his diſhoneſty and ambition had not tranſported him upon ſuch a Precipice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diaſpe</hi> came to kiſſe King <hi>Vaſſileo's</hi> hand, who received him with ſuch a welcome as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve who ſave the lives of Kings. <hi>Dianea</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelling her affection in the habit of Gratitude, could not ſatisfie her ſelfe in honouring him. We returned to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where the Conſolations and Applauſes of the Court were infinite: For upon ſuch occaſions alſo thoſe that hate are obliged to demonſtrate a joyfulneſs, leſt they ſhew their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs. All the Kindred of the Count of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thera</hi> abſented themſelves, that his Majeſty
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169974:43"/>ſhould take no other revenge of them, and to remove any ſuſpition of intending miſchiefe. The <hi>Thracian</hi> Galleys with the body of <hi>Amurit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> were ſent to <hi>Nicepolis</hi> with a true relation of what had paſſed. But I know not for all that, whether his mother &amp; brother gave credit to the truth; who believes he is offended, cares not for the cauſe. <hi>Diaſpe</hi> would not aske the Princeſs in marriage untill the arrivall of his, whom he ſhortly expected. He knew the ill inclination of the Court, who envying and hating his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour could not but with mortification behold the King and Princeſs to honour him. They ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that ſtolne from themſelves which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty conferred upon others, either for thankfulneſs or munificence.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs would have proceeded in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of thoſe, who either by power, or riches had rendred themſelves formidable, even to King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> himſelfe; who (becauſe he durſt not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them) diſsembled their faults; but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Princeſs gave ſignes of wearineſs, and that ſhe difficultly kept her eyes open that combated with ſleep, ſhe broke off her Rclation, both of them betaking themſelves to a moſt ſweet repoſe.</p>

Shee apparrelled her ſelfe with ſuch Veſtments as beſeemed her greatneſs; not accuſtoming her ſelfe to the ſuperfluity of thoſe Ornaments wherewith the Ladies of theſe dayes, following the vanity of their Genius, unprofitably waſte their times and lives. Her face was without Art, the colours not affected. Her haire curling by Nature, was gathered up, and bound under a very thin vaile, all beſet with Jewels. A ſhame to thoſe of our age, who to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169974:44"/>ſeem beautifull, when they are not, care not to appeare rather Pictures than women; and to rob Sepulchers of their ſpoiles, to deceive the eyes and judgements of thoſe that looke on them.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was ready, ſhe commanded her Damſels to withdraw, feigning her wonted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions. Being left alone, ſhe entred into the Cave, juſt as the Princeſſe had done dreſſing of her. There, after ſome courteous ſalutations, ſhe asked her how ſhee had paſſed that night in a place ſo below her Deſert, whiles ſhe diſturb'd with a thouſand Paſſions her ſelfe, had not for one minutes time, given her eyes any repoſe. The Princeſs anſwered ſhe had never taken better reſt, having caſt wholly from her memorie her former miſeries, finding her ſelfe to have ſo large a part in the affections of ſo great a Princeſſe; That now, if ſhe was oppreſſed with any thought, it proceeded from doubt that ſhe had been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to her, and that ſhe had nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her ſelf how gratefull ſhe was for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhe had received.</p>
            <p>They paſs'd forward into divers Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, repleat with love and gentleneſs, when <hi>Dianea</hi> ſaid: That having given ſome Truce to her owne particular Paſſions, ſhe had worn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a great part of the night in thinking of her; That to be (as it were) buried in Troubles and Dangers, the Diſcoverte of it would finde ſome adviſe to facilitate it with ſatisfaction. And that therefore ſhe entreated her to relate to her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169974:44"/>the Condition of her Fortune, and the Accidents of her life. From whence with better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and more mature Deliberation, they might lay hold on more proper and neceſſary Remedies.</p>
            <p>The Princeſſe reply'd, that ſhe had an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to recount to her the Encounters of her miſeries, who would commiſerate and aſſiſt her. That in misfortunes there is found no greater Conſolation then in the pittie we perceive in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Many times their Teares bleſſe Infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that compaſſionate it. Here for a while ſhe made a ſtop, as if ſhe would take breath, or as if ſhe waited for new commands.

               <p>In the firſt yeares of his Reigne, he enlarged the Confines of his Empire ſo proſperouſly, that it ſeemed Fortune in a Dreame had ſubjugated Provinces to him. All that confin'd to him, hee had made his Tributaries, and had borne ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull Armes, that his Conqueſts crowded one another, where alſo many times his owne ſouldiers found Sepulchers of glorie. He after fixed his minde upon higher Attempts, deſigning perhaps the recovery of that, which either by Fortune of warre, or other alienation had been uſurp'd from the Crowne of <hi>Negropont.</hi> But on the ſuddaine he was conſtrained to call back his Forces, to the defence of his owne State, invaded by moſt powerfull Armies of <hi>Lodaſo,</hi> King of <hi>Veſati,</hi> the moſt warlike that ever was borne of that Nation, the fierceſt, and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable in the world.</p>

The War being denounced, and we overcome, we began to feele all thoſe diſcommodities and miſeries which they receive who are ſeene unjuſtly diſpoyled, and robb'd of what they have, without any meanes to prevent it. Our principall Cities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through feare, or treachery, ſet open their Gates to the Enemie, ſo that the greateſt part
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169974:45"/>of his Dominions being loſt, we had nothing remaining but what this Iſland contained in it.</p>
               <p>My Father, who in many Battailes had found Fortune contrary to him, having gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the laſt Forces he was able to raiſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Duke of <hi>Lovaſtine,</hi> who from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Knight, by the Kings favour, with the envy of all, was advanced to this degree to Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his uttermoſt hopes on a ſet Field. The Duke readily obeyed the Commands of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and under <hi>Zenilp</hi> offered the Enemy bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, who more then willingly encountred him. This was one of the moſt obſtinate and bloudy fights they had: Even my memorie I confeſs hath loſt the remembrance of ſo cruel aſſaults. It began two hours after Sun-riſe, and continued till Noon, without the leaſt advantage to be perceived on either ſide. <hi>Lodato,</hi> that for valour would yield to none, ran through every thing, leaving it hard to be diſtinguiſhed, whether he was Generall, or a private Souldier. At laſt Victorie inclining to his ſide, and evident ſignes of having the better appearing; the Duke of <hi>Lovaſtine,</hi> all hope of overcomming being loſt, with a ſelect party of his beſt men charged that part where <hi>Lodato's</hi> Prowetle performed wonders. He alone aimed at him, and having unhorſed him, they wounded him mortally. His men, who obeyed him as a King, and adored him as a God, ſeeing him fall to the ground, ranne thither, making ſuch a ſlaughter of our men, that there almoſt all our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169974:46"/>Officers of note were ſlaine, the Duke of <hi>Lova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> being ſorely wounded. The <hi>Veſats</hi> had the victorie, though loſing their King: it was belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they had the worſt. He being brought off to his Pavillion, with ſo much undauntedneſſe exhorted his to proſecute the war, as if he had commanded over death. He recommended the Government of the Army to the Duke of <hi>Vima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> entreating his to continue without faction; becauſe they could not bee over-come, if they were not diſunited. And deſired his friends to dry their eyes; for hee could not have received a greater benefit from the Gods than to dye at the top of his glories, with his Armes in his hands; He had lived long enough he ſaid, who had the Fortune to point them out the way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. With theſe words he ended his life, with ſo great a ſorrow to his that many would not ſurvive him. His Exequies were not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, but the Bier many dayes carryed about the Army, with ſuch a ſadneſſe of the ſouldiers, that they (eſteeming Tears too or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a way to expeſſe their Paſſion and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) bathed it daily with bloud.</p>
               <p>Newes of this being brought to the Court, it was entertained according to ſeverall affections. The friends to the Crowne rejoyced at it, as if this onely blow had occaſioned our ſecurity and the ſafety of the State. But thoſe that expected to build their hopes upon our Precipices, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it with an extraordinary ſorrow, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd it with attempting to bring the Duke of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169974:46"/>into diſgrace with my Father, who being of an incredible goodneſſe, did not believe himſelfe deceived, nor that others would deceive him. His Majeſty for all this continued to reward him according to the merit of his valour, enriching him daily with Lordſhips, money, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſo that he had not in the Kingdome nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Superiour nor Equall. He being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of the Treacheries his Enemies intended him, writ to my Father: That having ſerv'd him ſo many yeares, careleſſe of his life, hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red now ſome repoſe, not to abſent himſelfe from dangers, or to withdraw himſelfe from his ſervice, but to cure himſelfe of ſome Evils which rendred him an old and an unable man before his time. That the charge of an Army was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great a Burthen for the ſhoulders of an old man, that had ſpent more bloud in the Service of the Crowne, then he had left for the preſervation of himſelfe. That the Intereſts of his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that others ſhould bee employed in the Wars, to ſupply his weakneſſes. Other Reſolute, but very Reſpectfull things he urged, which compelled <hi>Dinanderto</hi> to ſend to him expreſſely that he ſhould continue his command, adding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars of honour, the more to oblige him to him.</p>
               <p>The Duke for ſome time, to his very great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, proſecuted his charge; but underſtanding that his Enemies proceeded in multiplying crimes upon him, which never entred into his minde, that they treated about Articles of peace,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169974:47"/>without once mentioning him in them, and that the King of the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſent the Duke of <hi>Riat</hi> with a Command equall to his owne, having but an ill opinion of the Princes of <hi>Catanoſa,</hi> who were voluntiers in the Army; he began to thinke of ſome ſecurity for his owne ſafety. He ſet ſome Priſoners at liberty, without taking any thing from them, but a ſimple Teſtimony of honour. He negotiated effects of friendſhip with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the <hi>Belgi,</hi> of the <hi>Aquitans,</hi> and the <hi>Celta;</hi> and laſtly, ſo ordered the buſineſſe, that the greater part of the Heads, the Colonels, and the Captaines of the Army ſubſcribed to a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in the which they obliged themſelves to ſerve him in all encounters, and never to abandon him while they lived.</p>
               <p>My Father had Notice ſpeedily given him of all this; but not crediting theſe Relations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though proceeding from reaſons well affected and unintereſted, he would underſtand the truth with more certainty; he made the Duke of <hi>Laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Lovastine,</hi> to be brought into his preſence, unto whom he made a Diſcourſe of the Merits, of the Virtue, and of the Victories of the Generall, and that hee had reſolved to ſend him to him, to comfort him, and aſſure him, that ſiniſter informations could not alienate his heart from that man, whom he loved equall to himſelfe. That hee knew the wickedneſſe of Courts, where the moſt worthy are the ſooneſt expoſed to the injuries of malignity and envy. Upon this occaſion, he made one of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169974:47"/>of State to accompany him, giving him private Commiſſion to ſpy into the actions of the Duke of <hi>Lovaſtine,</hi> forcing himſelfe to penetrate even into his thoughts, his operations, and his ends. The Councellour being come to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was informed of the Rebellion of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, of his Treaties with the Enemies, and of a thouſand other particulars, which rendred him guilty. He gave his Majeſty notice of this, while ſome of the chiefe who had ſubſcribed to the Paper, came and ſignified it in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>My Father remained aſtoniſhed at an attempt ſo execrable. Conſidering that the ſumme of the buſineſſes conſiſted in the ſpeedy diſpatch of them, he declared the Duke of <hi>Lovaſtines</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Generall to be void, that he was a Rebell to the Crowne, and an enemy to his Prince, commanding all the Provinces that they ſhould not obey him, and promiſed high rewards to ſuch as ſhould deliver him into his hands. He committed the charge of his crimes to <hi>Colateral Picomeni,</hi> and to the Count of <hi>Lagaſſo,</hi> Subjects of an experimented worth. Thus he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he ſhould entertaine the enemy, and that he charged to take the Duke before he ſhould have time to defend or ſave himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lovaſtine</hi> was in a walled Towne in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Baeotia</hi> when he underſtood the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his Majeſty. Here, although he could have defended himſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, having Souldiers and Ammunition enough, perceiving the Colours of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169974:48"/>the Count of <hi>Lagaſſo,</hi> that intended to ſurprize him under the appearance of a friend, he fled thence with two Troopes of Horſe, and foure Colonells joyned to him by friendſhip and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. He retired into a Caſtle, the ſtrongeſt of <hi>Baeetia,</hi> with hope there to defend himſelfe from all the Forces of the world. The ſcituation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it inexpugnable by Nature and Art. The Souldiers were of a try'd fidelity, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour his Creature, by him elected to that Command, a ſtranger by birth, for the moſt part valerous, the moſt worthy, and the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Adviſes of <hi>Lagaſſo</hi> were brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the arrivall of the Duke; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Governour (after he had received him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle, and had ſaluted him with wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come belonging to a Subject, and a Subject ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged with benefits) he reſolved to ſecure him. He ſhut the Duke up in a Chamber, moleſted with thoughts, or indiſpoſitions of health, and without taking any meat, gave order he ſhould be left to his repoſe. The reſt, being invited by the Governour, went with him to ſupper, where almoſt all that were acquainted with his purpoſe came among them, and a certaine ſigne being given, they were ſlaine with little or no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Being ſurpriſed, they had ſcarce time to lay hold on their Swords, two of them being killed before they could riſe from their ſeats. From thence, preſently after, they went to the Chamber where the Duke was, and breaking down the doore they ruſhed violently in. He
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169974:48"/>ſtarting up, ran to a window, either to leap forth, or to call out for help. Perceiving the height mortall, to eſcape impoſſible, and his Guard out of the way, he leapt upon a ſouldier to take his Halbert from him. They with ſo much cunning proſecuted their buſineſſe, that the Duke unwittingly wounded himſelfe mortally upon it. He after ſpoke many words, proteſting his innocency. That he fled from the anger of his Majeſty without any other meaning but to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelfe; That if he had had any intention upon the Kings life, or on the Kingdom, he could not have wanted waies more ſecure and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; That he appealed to his Majeſty when he would caſt aſide the ill impreſſion he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his ill-willers, and deſired him with all ſeverity to weigh his Actions. He aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the miſery of thoſe who are neceſſitated to ſerve the Grandees of the world, that can do what they will.</p>
               <p>The ſtanders by ſuffered him to ſpeake till he breathed out his ſoule, either for the reverence they bore him, who many times had commanded even the King himſelfe, or elſe becauſe, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a dying, they eſteemed it an impiety to be cruell to a Carkaſſe. My Father at the report of theſe things could not refraine from teares; he commanded ſacrifices ſhould be offered to the Gods for the good of his ſoule. Although many had a hand in this Conſpiracy, he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe only with the impriſonment of two. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it an high revenge if he made others
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169974:49"/>ſee, that if he had a mind he had power to puniſh offenders.</p>
               <p>Theſe extreames of his goodneſſe gave leave to ſome wicked men to aggravate the Innocency of the Duke of <hi>Lovaſtine</hi> in ſo free diſcourſes, that my Father was in a very great feare of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. They ſaid, the ſervices he had done to the Crown merited not a death ſo much the more miſerable, becauſe it was infamous. That that ſhould not be denied to the greateſt man of the world, which is not refuſed to the leaſt. That <hi>Dinanderto</hi> learnt ingratitude of other Princes, which was a blameable fault in all, but a curſed one in his Majeſty, that would have his owne goodneſſe and piety believed greater than the deſerts of the other. That the Kingdome had felt the dammage of ſuch a loſſe. And that the Enemy had never had a compleater victory than now by the death of ſo great a Commander.</p>
               <p>Only the Duke of <hi>Laſſimano, Lovaſtines</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, aggravating the Crimes of his Uncle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed my Father of too much gentleneſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented, that the life of only one ſhould be ſacrificed for his ſafetie and feares; That had he been guilty of no other faults but his intelligence with the Enemies of the Crown, that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to render him worthy of any Puniſhment. Theſe aggravations in a manner ſo won upon the goodneſſe of my Father, who (not conſidering that injuries are never forgot, and that being writ indelebly in the heart, they dye not but with the heart it ſelfe) conferred all poſſible honours
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169974:49"/>upon him; and laſtly recommended to him the defence of himſelfe. His Majeſty remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the affection of this man, he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one deed that made him imagined very faithfull. My Father, being gone an hunting with almoſt all the Court, was ſurpriſed with a ſudden ſhowre, accompanied with haile, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and wind, that it ſeemed it would devoure the world. He got into a Cave to ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the fury of Heaven. Scarce was he entred within it, but broken, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by time or deſtiny, with an unexpected ruine it began to tumble down. All overcome with amazement preferred their owne ſafety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings, flying thence whither their feare carried them. The Duke, either out of bravery contemning death, or to authenticate his infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſupporting with his back what was ready to fall, with no ſmall danger to himſelfe, gave leiſure to my Father to eſcape forth, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent others in to bring him off, who had remained there in great danger to have ſunke under the weight.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty beleeving that theſe deeds could not be counterfeit, and that it was not poſſible that one ſhould hazard life for him he loved not, kept him alwaies neare him, and according to his liking were all Counſels determined, and all deliberations regulated. The perfidious man, growing proud of the proſperity of his Fortune, feigued himſelfe enamoured of me, with ſo much cunning, that it ſeemed he was willing to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169974:50"/>dye for love. I that could not endure to look on him, not ſo much becauſe he was Nephew to a Traytour, but becauſe formerly I had obliged my heart to the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> one of the moſt worthy and conſciouſeſt Princes that belonged to the ſervice of the Crown. My Father did not oppoſe my deſires, and if the Intereſſes of the War had not diverted, that thought had effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them. It was eaſie for <hi>Prodirto</hi> (for ſo was the Duke of <hi>Laſſimano</hi> called) perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe excluded, and flighted by me, to penetrate into my ends. Our practices were apparent to all; for I ſuppoſing my ſelfe, as it were, as good as married to him, there was not any thing that I omitted to make him beleeve me ſo. <hi>Prodirto</hi> ſtudied to free himſelfe of a Rivall, and did it under the ſpecies of honour, according to his uſuall cunning.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of the Prince my brother, a Generall of the Army was to be choſen, who not being yet ſixteen yeares of Age could not undergo the troubles of War. He ſerved himſelfe with this occaſion to ſend the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> far off. He propoſed this to the Councell of State, applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the greatneſſe of his mind, and the merits of his perſon, with ſo much eloquence, that he prevailed for his departure, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a thouſand oppoſitions, and infinite preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he was there choſen by the greater part of the Votes. The Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> being gone to his Charge, <hi>Prodirto</hi> applied his mind to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his wickedneſſes.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:169974:50"/>
               <p>My Father was given to love much more then was befitting a Prince; There was no other ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh upon his honours, but this of naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, reputed blameable in the opinion of all men: for although it be common to all, yet it is not ſo convenient for all. The Age of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was now declining, and two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which made him ſeeme older than he was, could not ſtop him in the purſuit of his pleaſures. He had received, preſented to him, a Greek of ſo ſingular beauties, that they would have overcome the continency of a thouſand <hi>Xenocrates's.</hi> The beauty of <hi>Venus,</hi> being ſubjected to compariſon, would have found in the face of her, at leaſt emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if not envy. To this my Father engaged all his affections; All the houres that he could ſteale from publick buſineſſe he ſpent in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or adoration of that Object, of which many times he had confeſſed himſelfe unworthy. He had kept her in his own Lodgings, if mine and my brothers yeares had not perſwaded him to the contrary. At the farther end of the Garden there were ſome Lodgings, with Pictures em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed, and Sculptures of the chiefe of their profeſſion. <hi>Pornia</hi> here was laid, for ſo was the name of that Greeke, with ſo much care of my Father, who not only would conceale her from the eyes of heaven, but many times became jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous even of his own ſelfe. <hi>Prodirto</hi> prevailing upon this occaſion, feigned ſome buſineſſe of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great conſequence with my Father. He told him, that <hi>Pornia</hi> weary of the cold embraces
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169974:51"/>of an old man, with a ſcorne to his Majeſty, almoſt every night enjoyed a young man belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Court of a very low condition. It was no difficult thing that this lye ſhould ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find credit with my Father: For ſome Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers beleeve impoſſible things true. He ſhewed ſo lively feelings of griefe, that it appeared his heart, preſaging his evill, did not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon oblige him to ſorrow. After various Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, he reſolved (being ſo perſwaded by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirto</hi>) to go with him alone in the darkeſt time of the night to puniſh that <hi>Prometheus,</hi> who durſt preſume to ſteale his fire.</p>
               <p>The Duke being gone, joyfull at this Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, went to find the Prince my brother: with whom it was no hard thing to worke a greater Art than that which he had uſed with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. He repreſented to him (after a feigned relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deed) that injuries done to the Father directly wounded the reputation of the Son, who ought the more to reſent them, becauſe he had the more ſtrength to revenge them. That his Majeſty could not receive a greater comfort than to ſee his Son ſo ardent in chaſtening injuries committed againſt his Father. That to publiſh it was ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, dangerous, and unhandſome. That though, peradventure, it ſhould be falſe when it ſhould chance to be reported to his Majeſty, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with an high opinion of him, and if that it were true, there could not be an eaſier and worthier revenge imagined than by his own hands. That it was an high great priviledge to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169974:51"/>Princes to have power to puniſh injuries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger to their friends. He alſo added the eaſineſs of the taske, not to have to doe with more then one man without Armes, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on on the ſuddaine, may be imagin'd ſoon kill'd. To be briefe, he did not omit any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that he thought might perſwade him. All Conſiderations were ſuperfluous, for the Prince was reſolved upon the knowledge of the Deed. He loved <hi>Pornia</hi> with no ordinarie affection, and conceited this Offence done againſt himſelfe. If he could, he would have got her before ſhe fell into the hands of his Father: afterwards, either for duty or feare he ſeemed not to care for her; although his deſires encreaſed, by reaſon, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed them.</p>
               <p>The night came ſo furniſhed with darkneſſe, (even palpable) that it could not be more obſcure. The unfortunate Father and Son believed Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was propitious to their Deſignes, being able amid'ſt theſe Honours to obſerve, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, which it meant to cover, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſo cruell an action. The Stars alſo vaniſhed all out of ſight, peradventure not to be call'd guilty of that Tragedy, the malignity of their Influencea, ordinarily being accus'd for that which depends abſolutely on our Wills. Or elſe they hid their heads to make their deaths appear more miſerable, in that they could not implore and ſee the Celeſtiall Luminaries.</p>
               <p>My Father giving himſelfe over to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the buſineſſe, by the will of <hi>Prodirto</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:169974:52"/>deſcended into the Garden, that very moment the Prince came thither. They encounter neare <hi>Pornia's</hi> Lodgings; each of them did imagine at whom they expected, and began to wound one another. They ſtruck but two blowes a piece, and none in vaine: The Prince received an hurt in his head, which broke his skull, and was runne in his breaſt through his body. My Father alſo had a wound which came out at his ſhoulder, but being in a fleſhy place, though it was dangerous, it was not mortall. The other, although no very great one, was in his throat, which hindred his breathing, and voice. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Prince fall, he ſaid he was alive, and called <hi>Prodirto,</hi> that he ſhould aide him. The Traytor ſuſpecting theſe words, might awaken the Souldiers, or the Court, although hardly heard by himſelfe, came againſt him, murthering him with many ſtabs of a Dagger, which he carried to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floridea</hi> here ſtaied, her teares interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her words. You cannot deny (ſaid ſhe) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unhappy Memory of my Father thoſe Rights of <hi>Amuritte,</hi> which being knowne in all, are more though then naturall in women. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing notwithſtanding her griefe with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſuflerance, ſhe proceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prodirto</hi> being gone out of the Garden, through a private doore, called together the greateſt part of his Kindred, who being certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the deed, without any reſiſtance tooke poſſeſſion of the City, They that were more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169974:52"/>honeſt, being aſtoniſhed at this chance, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to declare for my Right, were to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themſelves into danger of their lives, gave way to Fortune, rather then Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe ſtrange Changes were in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I enjoyed a moſt ſweet Retirement. I mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Deſtiny, which being evermore ready to vex me, now decived me with (as it were) a brave pleaſant ſleep. I was then for my Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Caſtle upon the Sea ſhore, and to obey the will of my Father, who much againſt his minde look'd upon thoſe that could reprove him of his Amours, although with ſilence. I was awakened out of it by the Guard, and <hi>Pornia</hi> was preſented to me, who more by her teares then by her words aſſured me of my evill. The griefe I received at it was ſo great, that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an alter'd woman, I deceived the opinion of others, not being able to deceive my owne ſorrow. They thought to have ſeen me run mad, overcome with Paſſion, which being growne to the height, ſuffered not any externall actions to disburthen my heart. That griefe is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary which is raiſed by weeping, and that can evaporate it ſelfe by ſhreeks and lamentation. Thoſe Diſeaſes are mortall which take away the life before they ſhew their Malignitie. Truely, I know not whether I was ſo eſtranged from my ſelfe by the greatneſſe of my ſorrow, or for feare of my ſelfe, which (from my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) repreſented to me a great deale more then the loſſe of my Father and brother.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:169974:53"/>
               <p>I was about doubling the Guards, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Caſtle juſt as the Traytor ſent to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it. When he underſtood his Attempt was fruſtrated, for anger hee made him to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, to whom he had given the Command. Many times Traytors exerciſe Juſtice, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are juſt, but becauſe Heaven will be ſerved by their impieties to puniſh wicked men. He beſieged me in the Caſtle, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made uſe of all affectionate words to gaine me without violence. Although I could have reſiſted all the Armies of the Kingdome, I could not, notwithſtanding fight againſt Neceſſity, there being Ammunition but for a Moneth. Their fidelity that preferr'd my ſafety above their owne could not bee cemented againſt Famine, which without combating can Conquer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I reſolved to ſend two of my truſty ſervants to the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> to implore his ſuccour. I gave him an account of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Prodirto,</hi> and the dangers of my Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and life. Although Lovers have no need of Spurs, I uſed all thoſe means that had power to perſwade even the minde of an Enemy. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered him that the Kingdom of <hi>Negrepont,</hi> expected from his Valour, a releaſe from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, that comming to my aide, hee brought a Defence for his owne Affaires. I added that I would have ſent him my heart, if a thing ſo deare that bore his Image on it would have been ſeparated by the Treacheries of Enemies, or the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169974:53"/>faith of a ſervant. I gave him notice alſo, that if he could not come with his Armie, he ſhould with one Galley, the Sea being free then, the Foe having no veſſels of conſideration, ſo that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedies failing, I might flie thence with him to preſerve alive my Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to eſcape from the hands of a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>In ten dayes an Anſwer returned, but not the meſſenger, being deceived by a counterfeit Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, I attended the Duke of <hi>Filena's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with that Anxiety a Lover can wiſh for, as it was promiſed me by the Letter, darker then uſuall, by the obſcureneſſe of the Treaſon they prepared. The appointed night being come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving I opened to the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> I found me between the Armes of <hi>Prodirto,</hi> who having ſecured my meſſengers by counterfeiting the Dukes hand, deceived me, he having neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity nor vertue to imitate the other in but onely his Characters. He had much adoe to hold my hand, which would preſerve my liberty in deſpight of the treacheries of Enemies. But proteſting all reſpect to mee, and promiſing me I ſhould receive no harme, hee pacified me.</p>
               <p>Although dayly he frequented my Company, he yet never forgot he was my Subject. His words were ſo courteous, his expreſſions ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, his Promiſes ſo great, that they very much leſſen'd my hatred, though it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to love him. Every day hee had the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169974:54"/>Souldiers in a readineſſe. The Commonalty hee obliged with Gifts, kept his friends together, entreated his kindred, and neglected no meanes that might aſſure the Crowne to him. All the principall Cities had ſworne obedience to him; ſome being overcome by a deſire of Novelty, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by force, and all by cunning. He had an Army more numerous than ſtrong: the poor he baniſhed; and the Male content followed the Standards of that impious man, who ought not to have been followed but by as wicked as hee. When he ſaw himſelfe freed from his feares, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the flatteries of thoſe that know not how to ſpeak to Princes, but of Felicity: or by a mighty quantity of Halberdiers that waited on him, he began to lay aſide that courteſie he had formerly uſed to me. Comming one day to talke with me, he ſaid:</p>
               <p>Princeſſe, If with my bloud I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the life of your Father and Brother, I would do it with that eagerneſſe which beſeems a Subject, who loves his Princeſſe equall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. After their Deceaſe I am put to the ſtern of this Ship, beat upon by the furie of Fortune, not to ſteale it from your greatneſſe and merits, but not to ſuffer it to be endangered among the Rocks of Ambition, and not to abandon it to the Incurſions of the moſt Barbarous, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious. Notwithſtanding this zeale of mine would ſhew little reſpect to the Acts of your Progenitors, and to the Eſtabliſhment of your Happineſſe, if I ſhould not procure to protect
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169974:54"/>your youth from the intentions of many, with joyning you in marriage to a perſon who is able to defend your Kingdome for you. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon Princes, that parallel you in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, I have found more oppoſitions then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities: Many either deform'd in minde, or countenance: Others incapable, or inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Kingdome. Laſtly, all either ſo full of thoſe Tenents, or of thoſe vices deteſted by others, but inſupportable to the people of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gropont.</hi> After many conſiderations I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that you cannot finde out a more ſecure ſtay, nor more to be authorized then my ſelfe. I am perſwaded no body will diſdaine to ſerve him who hath the Queen to his wife, and hath many times commanded the King himſelfe. I do not believe I am unworthy of you, not ſo much becauſe I exceedingly love you, but by reaſon I demand that, which by the right of Warre ought to be mine. You ought not to reſuſe me, if you have regard to the Danger your perſon is in, the ſecurity of your State, and to the quiet of your Subjects.</p>
               <p>He omitted not other Particulars, and other Maximes, accompanyed with ſo much craft, that they would have deceived thoſe that had not knowne him. I thought it not beſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, whoſe hands were no leſſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked then his heart. I believed that nothing elſe could ſave me, but making uſe of his Appaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to deceive Art by Art. I anſwered him: That this was not the firſt expreſſion of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169974:55"/>nor theſe the firſt Obligations that the Crowne of <hi>Negropont</hi> owed him: That if the Gods vonchſafed me to reigne, he ſhould find no ingrateful effects in it; that he ſhould have no occaſion to envy the felicity of any, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an higher greatneſſe. That I would eſtabliſh him in ſuch a condition, that he ſhould find his troubles abundantly rewarded, and his zeale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited. That concerning marriage, I neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, nor received him. That when peace and quietneſſe had ſecured the Crowne, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Scepter to me, I would follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Councell of State, the will of my friends, and of him in particular. That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it very neceſſary to have the opinion of the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> as one who at preſent was the Patron of the Armies neare the Kingdome: and that it was expedient to demand his advice, to expreſſe I eſpected him, although I ſhould diſpleaſe him.</p>
               <p>To theſe words he replyed, that he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Diſcourſe, as having its foundation upon ſafety, and reaſon: But that I ought to take notice, that weighty buſineſſes, if they were not proſecuted with ſpeed, encountred with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hindrances which retarded them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times confounds them. That it was an effect of weakneſſe to depend upon the deſires and the wills of others that aime for the moſt part at their owne proper Intereſts, not to the Greatneſs or Reputation of Princes. That Kings ſometimes admitted of Councell to heare the applauſes and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169974:55"/>approbations of their own opinions, not to be brought to theirs. What ſhould Princes be if they muſt depend on the Conſults, and be regulated by the odde humours of others. That at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of her Reigne ſhe ſhould not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her own authority. Subjects too often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon Juriſdiction, and endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Law to their King. Eſpecially, that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Prince for her Husband, not unworthy of her ſelfe, ſhe was not obliged to depend upon the will, no not of her Father himſelfe.</p>
               <p>I contradicting theſe opinions with many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and he enforcing himſelfe to confute the ſame, after many replies grew angry with me in his talke, and being cruell by nature, began to lay hands on me, ſaying; That he had power to perſwade me even without ſpeaking. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have killed my ſelfe, but it availed not. For he, fearing my reſolutions, gave me not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to lay hold on any thing. I gave way to my teares to try, if with the moſt lively bloud of my ſoule, I might purchſe my honeſty. This thought of mine took not effect, for there is no bloud that can mollifie an heart that is harder than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond. The perfidious man attempted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his deſignes now. My defences ſerved me to no other end, but to weaken my ſelfe, and exaſperate him the more. I that much rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death than the loſſe of mine honour, although I ſhould ſee my body but not my mind forc't, troubled him with repulſes, with bitings, with my nailes, not omitting ſchreekes and teares,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169974:56"/>that I know not how the ſtones eſcaped to be moved to Reſcue. <hi>Pornia,</hi> full of an incredible boldneſſe, ran in at this noiſe, tooke a dagger, which by chance lay there, and ſeeing the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he offered me, gave him ſuch a blow, that had it hit full, he had never more made uſe of force. Perceiving himſelfe ſtrook, he came againſt <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> who but weakly defending her ſelfe, ready to dye with many wounds, fell down. I ran into another Chamber, wherein there was nothing; but I imployed to ſecure the doore. He made not any uſe of his ſtrength againſt it: whereupon I being aſſured by thoſe that waited on me of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirto</hi>'s departure, came forth not to defraud <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> Funerall of my teares.</p>
               <p>There was in the Caſtle a little Temple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to <hi>Pallas.</hi> Hardly was I arrived there to make ready the Hearſe, when <hi>Prodirto</hi> entred, ſo changed in his countenance, that I beleeved him certainly come to murder me. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome of his by maine force to ſeize on me, making me to be carried into a Galley, which he had in readineſſe neare the Caſtle. Then he made them fall to their Oars exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them by his own voice, and haſting them by the whip. It was neceſſary for him to be gone, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> with all his Army was come to take him Priſoner. The Souldiery had ſuddenly revolted, and all the Cities had ſet their Gates open to him, and offered him their Keyes, the which in my name he received from all. We were not forty Leagues from the Iſland
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169974:56"/>but the Gods made <hi>Prodirto</hi> know how much they hated Traitours. At an inſtant the Sun was ſeen to be obſcured, the Aire darkened, and the Sea grown rough. Thunders and Lightnings ſtrove together to deprive the Marriners of their ſight and hearing. Many times it ſeemed, when we were mounted up by the Waves, that the Heavens opened to receive us, to ſtrike us with Lightning neare hand, as if the Thunder-bolts could not reach us further off. The Sterne was broken, the Maſt ſplit, the Tacklings unfit for uſe, the Anchors loſt, the Sailes torne, the Marriners amazed,, and the Slaves weary, when, defended only by the goodneſſe of our Veſſell, with a moſt proſperous preſage we came to ſhore in your Kingdome, in that port of the Iſland, which out of a reſpect to religion continues inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable.</p>
               <p>She would have related how, being led aſide by the Duke to eaſe himſelfe after the wearineſs of the ſea, ſhe had the opportunity to eſcape from him, if ſhe had not been prevented by the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Bell Prato,</hi> who put a letter into <hi>Dianeas</hi> hands; Knowing the hand, ſhe received it with ſuch a feeling as falls into that mind which feares, and hopes. Before ſhe read it ſhe ſaid to <hi>Floridea;</hi> Friend, and Siſter, for by theſe names I will ever call you, it is fit that I diſcover to your gentle diſpoſition all the ſeerets of my heart. This Letter comes from <hi>Diaſpe</hi> the Prince of <hi>Creete;</hi> the Character doth not deceive me; But whether as from an enemy or friend I know
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169974:57"/>not; becauſe your Arrivall here had diſturbed our appointments, and prevented our deſignes. Juſt when I firſt ſaw you, the Prince attended; you having barred up the Entrance, and I not in time giving him notice of it hath made him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence towards <hi>Creete.</hi> All my diligence hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto to find him hath proved fruitleſſe. Now he writes to me. I cannot but imagine he is angry. Heaven grant it be not implacable: Though I know that ſuch fits in Lovers are fomentations to affection. This ſaid, ſhe read the Letter; The Contents of which were theſe.</p>

Her tongue alſo ran for the ſuccour of her heart, uttering thoſe things which might vent out her griefe and leſſen her paſſion. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe man, ſaid ſhee, didſt thou want other meanes leſſe impious to ſatiate thy barbariſmes? Couldſt thou with waies more cruell diſdaine my Affections? With wickeder ſtratagems couldſt thou triumph over my ſimplicity? Couldſt thou with more diſguiſed Fictions betray my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency? Is this thy faith! theſe thy promiſes! theſe thy oaths! O <hi>Dianea,</hi> only unhappy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt loved.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169974:58"/>my Kingdomee, Life, and Honour? Wherefore preſerved you me ſafe from the furies of the ſea, to let me be ſwallowed up in an Occan of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Cruell one, are they Arguments that I can love others, becauſe I have loved thee? Thou ſhouldſt not therefore have doubted of it, being I cannot love my ſelfe. If I had, I ſhould not have diſpoſed my honour and fortune into the hands of a man, to whom inconſtancy is as proper as motion to the Heavens. Thou haſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe mee unfaithfull, becauſe I have betrayed my ſelfe. But where are thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that make my Innocency ſeeme guilty? How canſt thou convince my heart of diſloyalty, that out of an abundance of affection to thee grew jealous of it ſelfe? Ought I then to be convicted for a ſimple ſuſpition? Doubts then muſt ſerve for proofes againſt her, who to be be thine hath been willing to endanger her life, diſpleaſe her Subjects, and deceive her Father. Wicked man, I know thy perfidiouſneſſe. Becauſe thou canſt not love, thou feigneſt things for true which cannot fall under Imagination, much leſſe ſenſe.

                  <hi>Dianea</hi> no ſooner had finiſhed theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but <hi>Floridea</hi> would have tried all means to have comforted her, if ſhe had not been aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Dutcheſſe, that her Father who came to viſite her was not far off. At notice of this ſhe ſtopped the Torrent of thoſe teares, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169974:58"/>ran with her tongue to exaggerate her ſorrows. She forced her ſelfe to diſguiſe her paſſions, and to conceale thoſe ſigns that might make the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of a King jealous, whom Age had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his judgement. Having taken leave of <hi>Floridea,</hi> ſhe went to meet her Father, who was already entred into the Pallace. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave ſigne, by the paleneſſe of her face, and by the gaſtlineſſe of her eyes, of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her mind, and the alteration of her heart. Yet for the moſt part ſhe ſatisfied the feares of her Father, ſuſpitious at it; ſhe told him the cauſe, laying the blame on the night paſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe had neither ſlept, nor taken any repoſe; you had need therefore (replied <hi>Vaſſileo</hi>) chooſe you ſuch a Companion that ſhould provoke you to reſt, and taking her by the hand retired into the Garden, and ſaid to her:</p>
               <p>Daughter, ſince the unfortunate ſucceſſe of the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> I have had no greater thought than about your Marriage. You cannot remaine as you are, without danger to your ſelfe, and me. They that envy the happineſſe of my State, and aſpire to the Poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, under the pretence of wedding you, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either their infidelity, or ambition. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Count of <hi>Cithera</hi> ſhould teach Princes not to promote, with hopes, the wicked affections of their Subjects, and ſtrangers. There is not any who will not acknowledge himſelfe enamoured on your perſon, and your Kingdome. But ſhould other Motives be wanting, that of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169974:59"/>makes me deſirous; I wiſh to ſee my ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in my Grand-Children, which I would not leave in their Nonage in a Kingdome ſo great and powerfull, but yet not without enemies. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Kingdomes, the richer they are the more are they envied. Many make but ſlight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of that victory, which enricheth not the Conquerour, and great dangers ſtay not ſome from great pretenſions; your Nuptials will allay theſe ſuſpitions which deprive me of all conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. To theſe therefore I deſire your aſſent, which I beleeve cannot be contrary to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and my entreaties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea</hi> diſſembling thoſe afflictions that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her ſoule, after a little pauſe to recover her ſpirits, anſwered; Becks from your Majeſty ought by all to be received as Commands, not only by your Daughter, who hath learnt no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but obedience, and can ſerve you in nothing but obeying you. The King replied, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other anſwer he could not looke for from her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and affection: The Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> ſhall be your Husband, a young man to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting to render him ſuperiour to all, but a Kingdome, which you ſhall bring him in dowry. In peace he hath not his Equall, and in war none above him. The Kingdome of <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> which hath been the Theatre, whereon he hath acted the wonders of his valour, bewailes his abſence. He hath quieted the ſeditious, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the Rebels, returned liberty to the people, and not being elſe able to reſiſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169974:59"/>of thoſe who would have had him their King, he is hither retired into our Kingdome. Prepare you then, for I will remove all ſtops that may delay this Marriage. This ſaid, he parted from her, becauſe perceiving <hi>Dianea</hi> in a great perplexity of mind he would not trouble her farther, retiring joyfull to the Court, in that he had opened the buſineſſe, on which he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all his happineſſe depended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea,</hi> after her Fathers departure, finding her heart a narrow Veſſell for an Exceſſe of an over-flowing Love, exhaled her Paſſion in words, ſighes, and teares. Now ſhe called Heaven to be witneſſe of her Innocencie. Now blamed <hi>Cupid,</hi> that ingenerated in the hearts of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſuſpitions ſo farre from Truth. Now ſhe accuſed <hi>Diaſpe</hi> of injuſtice, who had concluded her guilty without hearing her defences. Now ſhe complained of Fortune, who (between her perpetuall motions of inconſtancy) was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall affliction to her. Now ſhe reproved her ſelfe of her errours, for ſo eaſily yielding to the Affections of that man which determine in the fruition of the Object. But when ſhe fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſideration of having promiſed her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to entertaine the marriage with the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> and to be deprived even of the hope of having <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> forgetting altogether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſſe becomming a Princeſſe; it appeared by her, that ſhe would not, or could not live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer. She beat the earth with her feet, becauſe ſhe having been believed a Heaven of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169974:60"/>Beauty, peradventure perſwaded her ſelfe that the Vapours of her Paſſions could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, but from the Earth. She ſtruck her face with her hands, as if ſhe meant to puniſh the beauty there, as Author of her Infelicity. Shee knocked her Breaſt, and it ſeemed ſhe would chaſe thence that Image which againſt her will tyrannized in her heart. Laſtly, ſhe tore her haire, making them guilty of <hi>Diaſpe's</hi> far away abſence, becauſe they had not the power to ſtay and entangle him. The ſenſe of her ſorrow cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to torment her: And theſe Rages which came as Natures under-Aſſiſtants for the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her minde, augmented the oppreſſions of it. Finally, overcome and caſt downe by the Aſſault of of many paſſions, ſhe was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by a violent Fever, to betake her ſelfe to her Bed, whilſt her griefes preſaged nothing but her Death.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs uſed all meanes to comfort her, repreſenting to her infinite expectations; very well knowing, that hope, although remote, is the true nouriſhment of Love, and the onely Conſolation of Lovers. When ſhee perceived her tired, with a Conquering ſorrow, and that it ſeemed that her eyes which were even drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with weeping, deſired Repoſe, deſpight of griefe, which wiſhed to ſee her engaged to a perpetuall Lamentation, ſhe went from her to <hi>Floridea</hi> in the Cave. To whom ſhe recounted the ill-fortune of the Princeſs, and the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had taken to diſoblige her heart from
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169974:60"/>
                  <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> obeying her Father, and marrying the Duke of <hi>Filena.</hi> The Dutcheſs had underſtood from <hi>Dianea,</hi> King <hi>Vaſſileo's</hi> Intention, but knew nothing of the Love that had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Floridea,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Filena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Floridea</hi> heard the Duke named, with a great alteration, ſhe beſeeched, who was that Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> who was accounted worthy of ſuch a Princeſs. The Dutcheſs anſwered her, he was the moſt celebrated King at that time Fame reported, and that enoblized the Glories of his bloud, by the wonders of his Vertue, by which hee had conquered envy it ſelfe. That King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> even when he was a great way hence, had elected him for his ſonne, and that not many dayes ſince he arrived here to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize theſe Nuptialls, which moſt ſumptuouſly are a preparing. <hi>Floridea</hi> had ſcarce heard the ſenſe of theſe laſt words, but being ſurprized with a trembling of the heart, ſhe beſeeched the Dutcheſs to leave her, untill ſhe had paſsed over that fit, which ſhe conceived of little moment, being accuſtomed formerly to have greater. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, ſhe gave liberty to her tongue, that accompanying her eyes, they might celebrate the Funerall of her hopes.</p>
               <p>Unfortunate (cry'd ſhe) are they that found their Deſires upon the inconſtancies of Fortune. I grew proud in holding her by the haire, and perſwaded my ſelf, I might with all ſecurity reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me in the midd'ſt of her wheele, having been ſheltered from the Barbariſmes of Traytors,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169974:61"/>preſerved from the Furies of the Sea, and to have found ſo large a ſhare in the affections of ſo great a Princeſs; and now I ſee my ſelfe a new reduced to that condition, that Death would be the leaſt of my miſeries. How uncertaine are our Thoughts! How vaine our Deſignes! How beguiled our Hopes! and how betray'd our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions! I imagined that this Grot, that had hid me from the cruelty of mine enemies, would have alſo preſerved me from the cruelleſt blowes of Deſtiny. I believed it had not been able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into this Cave which the Sun dares not diſcloſe. Ah me unhappy! what Remedy ſhall I look for? I have found the ill, and Death hath mocked me with an appearance of Recoverie. I am like thoſe Flies, which burne themſelves in that fire, which they believed would have che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them. But to whom profits it me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, ſince 'tis in the power of this hand to releaſe me from all the moleſtations of the world? That woman is too much miſerable that hath no other meanes to eaſe her of her miſerie, but her teares. But I have a Courage to dye when I will, and that envies not the conſtancie of thoſe breaſts, that being of a leſs fraile Sex, are judged therefore the more generous. But whither doth my griefe tranſport my tongue, and my reaſon make me wander? For the preſent, I ought not, nor can I dye: For being the Duke of <hi>Filena's,</hi> I ſhould not relinquiſh his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. I ought to depend upon his will, and to heare my ſelfe his Reſolutions. Others reports
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169974:61"/>for the moſt part, are either intereſted or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In the affaires of Love, the circumſtances give, and take away life: When thou ſhalt ſay, (O Duke of <hi>Filena</hi>) thou wilt not be mine; When thou ſhalt refuſe that Sacrifice thou haſt of my heart, then I can diſpoſe of my ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my pleaſure. At the preſent my thought could not be innocent, if it ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thy right. If thou wilt have <hi>Dianea,</hi> I will not oppoſe thee. For I ſhould love thee but a little, if for my proper Intereſt I ſhould deprive thee of ſo gratefull a thing. Nevertheleſs, I know, that I offend thee, making that faith du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, which I have always ſerved with ſo much loyalty.</p>
               <p>Thus complayning without attending the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the Dutcheſſe, as if ſhee hated thoſe Roomes, fearing no longer <hi>Prodirto,</hi> nor the Encounters of Fortune, ſhe went forth of the Cave, with the greateſt anxiety that could be, taking that path which to her judgement might lead her whither her heart deſigned her. By the way ſhe deviſed how ſhe ſhould appeare to the Duke of <hi>Filena.</hi> She prepared words premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, conceits which were by her ſelfe now accuſed as too humble, and now rejected as over-rigorous. Shee contriv'd, if ſhee found her ſelfe deſpiſed, how ſhe ſhould amplifie her ſorrowes. And meditated if accepted of, by what wayes ſhe ſhould conceale her joy.</p>
               <p>Whilſt ſhe agitated by theſe Paſſions, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Incommodities of her travaile more
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169974:62"/>ſupportable, <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> who had reſolved to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the world, and to live amidſt ſolitudes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſturbance of thoſe thoughts which make us abhorre life, condemning his opinion for baſe, had hired a great Barke to tranſport him to <hi>Creet.</hi> He thought with himſelfe; The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to ones Countrie and Father to exceed all others. All ſorrowes are comforted under that Heaven where all Influences are Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. He was ſcarce deſcry'd a good way from the Port, but that he told the Mariners they ſhould preſently receive him. Conſtancy may have reſidency in all things but the minds of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. He feigned ſome buſineſſe that he had, and commanded them to paſſe away the time till his returne. He walked towards the Grott, carried, I believe, more by his heart than his feet. Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, finding the entrance open, he boldly entered, imagining, peradventure, to find <hi>Dianea</hi> in ſome errour.</p>
               <p>Being come into the Court, he ſaw that Knight whom he had left for dead reſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon a ſtone. He reſolved no more to be deceived by the infidelity of her that introduced others into thoſe Chambers, into the which he had perſwaded himſelfe that he only was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But having left him on the earth breathleſs, and ſeeing him at the preſent in a very good ſtate of health, he imagined them phantaſmes of ſleep, or deluſions of Enchantments. He unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelfe with his ſword, aſſailing him, who, after the manner of <hi>Anteus,</hi> aroſe more
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169974:62"/>vigorous by his falls. Offences and defences were at the ſame time. Blows were given and returned equally; victory was independent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Palme bow towards either of them. The fight continued about an houre, maintained more by their anger than ſtrengths. Each of them blamed the edge of his ſword, and the weakneſs of his Arme that ſtrooke not down and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed his enemy. They were both of them all ſoyled with bloud, and it ſeemed death would have the Triumph of the fight, and of their lives. They could not any longer keep them on their feet, when after a long wreſtling they fell down both together, leaving life in his hands who ſhould dye the laſt. Their wounds truly were not mortall, but thoſe alſo being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain opened which they had received before, they were ſo weakened by the much bloud they loſt, that there appeared no ſigne that might make them thought alive.</p>
               <p>At this very inſtant <hi>Dianea,</hi> who had taken truce from her ſorrow, deſcended into the Cave to make <hi>Floridea</hi> acquainted with their both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning miſeries. At firſt ſight ſhe grew aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſeeing two Carkaſſes to be the Object of her eyes. She preſently received it as a Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of that wretchedneſſe which Fortune prepared for her. Suſpitious, and doubtfull, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſatisfied who they were that were come to ſolemnize (by dying) their Funerals in thoſe retiring places; ſhe ſaw <hi>Diaſpe</hi>'s face, that all over-ſpread with paleneſſe, it ſeemed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169974:63"/>her aide, his tongue being unable to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore it; ſhe ſchreeked not out, becauſe her heart oppreſſed by a violent paſſion, hindred her voice, ſo that ſhe could not ſpeake; ſhe ranne to embrace him, as if ſhe would bury him in her ſelfe, beleeving that ſhe could not give a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre more worthy to a Carkaſle ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. As ſoone as ſhe perceived there was yet ſome hope of life, with impatiency ſhe tore what came next to her hands to bind up his wounds, having yet before with a <hi>Jaſper</hi> ſtone, which ſhe had in a Ring, ſtanched his bloud.</p>
               <p>Whiles <hi>Dianea</hi> held him in her armes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little returned to himſelfe, breathing out a languiſhing ſigh, opened his eyes, which met with thoſe of hers, whom he loved and hated at the ſame inſtant. He preſently cloſed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſuppoſing his heart attempted to deceive his ſight with thoſe phantaſmes; and that the ſtrength of imagination made unpreſent Objects ſeeme viſible. Whereupon with a weeping voice he ſaid: Haſt not thou (O Fortune) yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſatiated the cruelty of thy deſires, that thou repreſenteſt to me that Image that is more tormentfull to me than that death which I know approacheth. Thou believeſt (may be) theſe wounds are not ſufficient to kill me, without ſtriking me with an Object ſo diſmall; or rather, I having no part of my body but mine eyes which can be offended, thou haſt tormented them with a Ghoſt, with a Phantaſme ſo noyous, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtfull.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:169974:63"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea</hi> could returne no anſwer to theſe words, but with her teares, which abundantly guſhing from her eyes, made <hi>Diaſpe</hi> underſtand he was in the armes of her, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more beloved than hated. Many times he endeavoured to have riſen, but being with-held by force, he added; What pity (perfidious one) is thine, who, having murthered me alive, now wouldſt lament me dead? Complaine the Teſtimonies of thy diſloyalty. O Lovers, give you credit to the doubleneſs of that heart that can bemoane whom it hath betrayed! Reſerve theſe teares, <hi>Dianea,</hi> to contrive treaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſimplicitie of ſome body that knows thee not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea,</hi> being unable to endure theſe words, which caſt a ſhadow on her loyalty, interrupting him, anſwered: Deare <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> if you had loved me you could not have doubted of the certainty of my faith. Suſpitions are not begot but where there is little love. I neither will, nor can affect others beſides you. I have but one heart which can entertaine the impreſſion of but one alone Object. Would to heaven, replied <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> that I could beguile my heart to beleeve thee innocent. I would dye a thouſand times rather than ſee you miſerable. And I anſwered, <hi>Dianea</hi> would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter death ſo many times more not to be ſuch. If you afford beliefe to my teares and oaths, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit theſe hands, which offer to ſubſcribe my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency with my bloud. So having ſaid, ſhe tooke <hi>Diaſpe's</hi> Dagger to ſtrike her ſelfe. He
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169974:64"/>adding ſtrength to his weakneſſe, with held her, and ſaid to her: And who is this Knight? What motives hath provoked him? Or by whom is he perſwaded to betray my life, and ſpy out theſe retiring places? I ſee him new enlivened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my miſeries. I left him dead at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Grott, and to day Deſtiny hath made me find him more ſtout than ever. I know not how, replied <hi>Dianea</hi> preſently to give you a greater account of theſe Accidents than that which you may conceive of your ſelfe. Theſe Adventures are as ſtrange to me as your diſdaine came unimagined. I beſeech heaven this Knight may live, that I may recover health from that hand which wounded me.</p>
               <p>But theſe Diſcourſes bring with them no ſalve for your hurts. <hi>Dianea</hi> is yours, and cannot be anothers. You much trouble her when you ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her ſuch. But rather you injure your ſelfe, manifeſting demerits, which vexe and toyle the Affections of a Princeſſe. Hereupon riſing ſhe would have led him into one of thoſe Chambers, but he would not conſent till he had ſeen if the Duke were in a condition likely to live. They found he was very far ſpent with the loſſe of much bloud; a ſigne that gave them little hope of life. There were two beds, by the aſſiſtance of the Dutcheſſe, preſently prepared, where they wounded were laid. <hi>Dianea</hi> attended to their Cure, being very well inſtructed in Chirurgery; not in that the Princeſſes of thoſe times were skilfull in all the Sciences, and in this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169974:64"/>as moſt neceſſary in the Pallaces of Princes, who will not truſt their healths to the infidelity of others hands, but becauſe from her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood her Genius had inclined her to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oleandro</hi> in this while, with an impetuous beating of the heart, met with the Count of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linera,</hi> to whom he had given knowledge of his Arrivall. Divers Complements paſsed, which alwaies abound in the mouths of Great men. Sitting down in a Chamber of the Pallace, and diſmiſſing his Attendants, who for the moſt part uſe to ſpy into the Actions of their Patrons, the Count of <hi>Salinera</hi> ſpoke thus: Prince <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro,</hi> it transfixes my ſoule, that the firſt day in which I have had the fortune to reverence you ſhould be funeralized with things moſt moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him who is to execute them, and with ſorrow to him that commands them. But I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to talke with a Prince, who counterpoiſeth all actions with reaſon, and treating of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State, which is the ſoule that quickens the body publike, you will receive thoſe Offices in good part, which though they appeare unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant are nevertheleſse neceſsary. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you of the miſeries of this Kingdome, which at the preſent enjoyes no other quiet, nor other felicity than that which an ideall, and an imaginary hope can promiſe us. It is known to all, and I ſuppoſe to you in particular, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne to command, you are obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Cuſtomes of people, and the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of Princes more than any other. Laws are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169974:65"/>here either neglected, or abuſed. Juſtice ſet to ſale hath rendred intereſſed Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. The Nobility are become Tyrants over the Commonalty. The people fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Chances of Fortune, have forgot their Obedience. Honours are diſpenced at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Deſert and Vertue are ſuppreſſed by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and riches. The power of King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> in a manner is reſtrained, ſo that he is ſcarce the Maſtor of himſelfe. Some that have gained the chiefe Offices, keep his eares as it were ſo beſieged, that he ſuſpects not ill though he prove it. And yet he hath beene adviſed by many, who have not feared to ruine themſelves to ſave the Prince. This Advertiſement hath been, if not too late, at leaſt untimely; ſo that to apply a Remedy was to encreaſe, not to remove the Evill. The ſucceſſes in the Kingdome have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his Majeſtie to ſuffer the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould not grow worſe. He that for Wiſedome knowes neither a Superiour nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, hath been unwilling to ſtirre thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which before they can be diſſolved will deſtroy the Body. The Death of the Count of <hi>Cithera,</hi> a young man, that by his Liberalities had won the Affections of all, have ſo aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from the King, that the moſt ſeditious now attend but for a new occaſion to diſguiſe the Impiety of their Deſignes.</p>
               <p>To our Domeſtick miſeries, externall are joyned. The King of <hi>Thacia</hi> and <hi>Armenia</hi> unite their Armies to invade us; the one to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169974:65"/>revenge the death of his Brother, and the other that of a ſon, as if King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> himſelfe had been the Author of them. The Chance (although it was of pure Fortune) is (without reaſon) aſcribed to his Majeſtie: but to thoſe that have an intention to wage warre, all Appearances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Cauſes. Kings, that have innumerable men and money, make that lawfull which they will, and under a mantle of Juſtice conceale their Ambition and Cruelty. In ſumme, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion hath put his Majeſty into grave delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; for he ſhall at once be combated with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies he knowes not; and have occaſion to feare his owne as much as he doth the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Thracians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To withdraw himſelfe from ſo imminent dangers, he hath procur'd to make friendſhip with Princes his Neighbours, and thoſe farther off. Some of them he hath awakened with this univerſall Maxime: That the greatneſſe of the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Thracians</hi> cannot be but with perill to them. To give way that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of others ſhould exceed their owne, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers their Liberty to the diſcretion of an inſolent; for ſuch are Conquerours. Many he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the ties of bloud, and others he hath put in minde of injuries received from theſe two Kingdomes: Some alſo he hath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of the Services hee done them. In briefe, hee hath not omitted any occaſion nor notice to gaine him the hearts of thoſe, who though they cannot aide him, at leaſt ſhall doe him no harme.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:169974:66"/>
               <p>In <hi>Africk</hi> he hath ſounded the Affections of all, and hath there found ſuch a forwardneſſe, that the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with his Couſin the new King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> have offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to fall upon the Kingdome of <hi>Thracia</hi> to divert him, or take from him the occaſion to invade us; knowing their State-Tenents not to maintaine two warres at one time. This fell out gratefull to his Majeſtie, becauſe the onely forces of <hi>Armenia</hi> could not daunt ours, to whom for a long continuance of yeares they have alwayes yielded obedience ſo much the more, being under the command of a King who never had combated with other but wilde Beaſts.</p>
               <p>But this joy of King <hi>Vaſſileo's</hi> was mortified by notice given him that the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> diſpatched Embaſladours to have your Perſon delivered him; imagining himſelfe whilſt you lived, neither ſecure nor King. His injuſtices are ſo deteſtable to his Subjects, that they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray Heaven for your Returne. If the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things did not neceſſitate my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to any agreement, though unjuſt (for the Lawes of neceſſity are without Law; and it is allowable to doe every thing rather then fall) you ſhould have no cauſe to feare any, and hee with as much Reſolution would undertake your defence, as now it grieves him to deſire your Departure. He hath committed to my charge to informe you of the ſtate of things, and that he himſelfe not being ſafe, can much leſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169974:66"/>others. He knowes that daily there are Treacheries woven againſt you, and knowes that not long ſince you were dangerouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: He heard it with as much ſorrow as can be imagined in a juſt Prince, conſtrained to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port injuſtices.</p>
               <p>He entreats you therefore with the greateſt privacy poſſible, to goe hence, that he be not compell'd to doe wrong either to you or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. He for feare of having it diſcovered, conceiving it dangerous to appoint you Veſſells for your Tranſportation, as a Preſent hath ſent you theſe Jewels, inferiour to your merit, but perhaps needfull in the Encounters of your new fortune. Though you were reſolved to have continued here, his Majeſtie deſires you to goe, and aſſures you, you ſhall doe it with ſafety: and will maintain that faith which he promiſed you, when firſt he knew his condition and birth. He is confident your wiſedome will apprehend this Counſell, as the ſecureſt for the ſafety and reputation of you both. <hi>Cyprus</hi> is not worthy to poſſeſs ſuch a Prince. You may with ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty promiſe to your ſelfe, that theſe feares of Warre being ceas'd, this Kingdome ſhall ſerve you as a Sanctuarie, and that King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others will intereſt himſelfe to favour you in the regaining you your Crowne. He loves Juſtice more then others, and cannot endure that the wicked ſhould triumph over innocency. The rather by reaſon the cauſe is common to all, Kings oughting not to ſuffer Uſurpation of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169974:67"/>States in others, leſt they finde the experience of it in their owne.</p>
               <p>Here the Count of <hi>Salinera</hi> held his peace. Whereupon <hi>Oleandro</hi> replyed: I aſcribe it (my Lord) to my great fortune, that the Majeſty of King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> ſo much intereſts himſelfe in my Calamities. I ſhall not alwayes remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, being protected by ſuch a Prince. I will be gone becauſe he deſires it, and goe willingly: Becauſe Miſfortunes ever attend me, I would not diſquiet the ſafetie of his Kingdom. I will take along with me theſe Jewels, which he hath pleaſed to honour me with, not that I have need of them, but to have daily before mine eyes Teſtimonies of his Magnanimity, Greatneſſe, and my obligations. I ſhould thank him for what he hath done, and for what hee hath promiſed to doe for me, if theſe Duties were not common in all tongues. So great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements claim a reverent Acknowledgement, which is ordinarily more expreſſed by ſilence then the tongue. The reaſons you have alledged were uſeleſſe to perſwade me. It ſufficeth that I ſee the Intereſts of the King or Kingdome to move me.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe being finiſhed, the Count of <hi>Salinera</hi> bad him farewell, with a reſentment more lively and true then thoſe that are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Courts. <hi>Oleandro</hi> complaining on the infiniteneſſe of his miſeries, prepared himſelfe with <hi>Arnalta</hi> for their Departure. Their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits were poore, his face he disfigured with a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169974:67"/>thouſand blemiſhes. So Fortune knowes how to jeſt even with Princes. They that knew how to diſguiſe themſelves ſo, knew not how they ſhould have knowne themſelves. <hi>Celardo</hi> uſed all meanes to have borne them Company, But being over-come by reaſons and prayers, was enforced to move it no farther, remaining in the poſſeſſion of the Pallace.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Princes departed before the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Sunne could diſcover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. When they came to the Sea ſide, they were ſo weary they could hardly ſtand. Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may trouble, but never can diſcourage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy minds. Finding a Veſſell, they went aboard it, which ſet ſaile that very night. The moſt noble Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was out of ſight when they were (rowſed on a ſuddaine by the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Sea) aſsaulted by the winds, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners were conſtrained to fall to land on a Rock, where by the help of ſwimming and Planks, they eſcaped from the water. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being unknowne, they put themſelves to walk afoot at adventure, whilſt the other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves to recover the ſhip-wrackt goods, which it ſeemed were ſpewed up by the Sea with a great fury upon thoſe ſhores. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one houre and more of travailing they came to ſome Shepheards Cabbins, from whom they received meat and lodging the next night. Theſe People, although they could not underſtand them, nor were underſtood, with a thouſand ſignes of courteſie could not weary themſelves
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169974:68"/>with doing them honour. In minds baſe by birth many times are found gentleneſſe, which great Ones either know not how to uſe, or will not. Morning being come, they departed by break of day, to find out ſome City where they might at leiſure deliberate of what they ſhould do.</p>
               <p>They walked till that time of the day that the body requires the naturall tribute of meats. They reſted them neare a Fountaine, and after their Repaſt gave themſelves over to ſleep, willing with a moſt pleaſing repoſe to ſlight that fortune which only aimed to diſquiet them. Whileſt they lay in this faſhion a Knight came upon them, for ſo he appeared by his Armes, and his Apparell. He caſt his eyes upon <hi>Arnalta,</hi> and praiſing much that beauty, he fixed his look upon <hi>Oleandro.</hi> He preſently knew him, though ſo unlike to himſelfe. There is not any thing that can be concealed from the eyes of a Lover, His Travels, Miſfortunes, Calamities had not ſo transformed him, that he could not be known for <hi>Oleandro</hi> by her that loved him.</p>
               <p>Being aſsured that he was the very ſame, ſhe trembled, ſwet, grew cold, became unmoveable. She was doubtfull whether ſhe ought firſt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him with injuries or kiſses. Before ſhe would have been content that he had been ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo that ſhe might have ſeen him: Now ſhe rather wiſheth him dead, than by the effects to diſcover certainly his perfidiouſneſs, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with her ſelfe that he weary and ſatiated with the Amours of her Siſter, this with him
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169974:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>was a new Miſtris. Finally, recollecting the reaſons of her diſpleaſure, unſheathing his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhe ſaid: <hi>Oleandro,</hi> now is the time thou ſhalt pay for injuries committed againſt my faith and the honour of my Family. It is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I ſhould endure that hatefull look which ſo many times I have found guilty. I ought not to let that man live, who with his only look can reprove me of my follies, and provoke bluſhes in that face he hath been able to ſlight. Thou (O wicked man) ſhalt prove what diſdaine in the breaſt of a loving woman can do. Oh God! how fooliſh I am. How I yet love this impious man, that with this dagger, and death, know not but that I may make him happy. Would not he be fortunate if he might be freed from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and enter into a place where my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred could not arrive. Impious and ſacrilegious perſons, whoſe hearts are repleniſhed with all barbariſmes, cannot for all that abide to looke upon the Teſtimonies of their wickedneſses. Thou ſhalt receive more vexation with ſeeing me, and hearing me aggravate thy perfidiouſneſs, than if I killed thee a thouſand times. Theſe Armes are too worthy for the breaſt of a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. I will not honour nor immortallize thy death with theſe hands, which would even raze thy name out of the booke of Oblivion it ſelfe. But I know very well how to torment thee. I will kill her here, whom I doubt not but if thou loveſt, thou wilt receive that puniſhment I wiſh thee.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:169974:69"/>
               <p>So ſaying, ſhe drew neare to <hi>Arnalta,</hi> and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly lifting up the Dagger held it in the aire, ſaying to her ſelfe: In what hath this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one offended me, that I ſhould thus miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deprive her of life? I ſhould not be angry with her for loving him, for I alſo have been in the ſame errour. Minds cannot be ſo compelled, that they ſhould not deſire the fruition of what ſeems good. And if ſhe deſerves any chaſtiſement, what greater puniſhment can <hi>I</hi> give her than the company of ſo faithleſs a man, that promiſing her all felicity will make her miſerable. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves puniſhment, and to him <hi>I</hi> ſhould give it; whereupon turning towards <hi>Oleandro</hi> to ſtrike him, ſhe was againe withheld with an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at her ſelfe. Is not this the man, ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with her ſelfe, that hath had the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over my heart? Do not <hi>I</hi> love him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, more than my ſoule? 'Tis true, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be beloved; 'tis true, he loves not me, and 'tis true, he is a Traitour: But how can my affection be aſsuredlier fixed than in his alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? To love being beloved is an Obligation. I ought to affect <hi>Oleandro</hi> through Gratitude, and to comply with my heart. The affections of one beloved ſhould be won by obſequiouſneſſe, and not ſteele. Cruelty is altogether an adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Love. If I kill him, I can never hope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, who living may become ſenſible of his errour, and re-affect me. And more, if I love him, I ſhould accommodate my ſelfe to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. I ſhould only love my own ſatisfaction if I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169974:69"/>ſhould not affect him, but becauſe he loved me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The Obligation of any that loves in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt is to be transformed into the Genius of the beloved. It is nevertheleſſe good reaſon that I take from my eyes what may alienate him from my love, and moleſt me. She is a foole that can have the patience to endure a Rivall.</p>
               <p>Having made theſe conſiderations, ſhe came againe to <hi>Arnalta,</hi> and againe ſtayed her hand that was ready to ſtrike her. If I deſire (ſaid ſhe) the affection of <hi>Oleandro,</hi> why offend I him with killing one who is his Companion? If he truly affect her, and intends to preferre her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, ſeeing her murthered by my hands, he will much more hate me. If I would enjoy the Affection of <hi>Oleandro,</hi> it is neceſſary that I procure it by parelling this, whom I ſuppoſe his Miſtris. When in her preſence he ſhall profeſſe he loves me, I ſhall not be deceived. What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would it be to me if he ſhould love me out neceſſity, not having where to divert his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? How can one rejoyce in that love which cannot be cimented by a Paragon. Ah foole, that I am! preſume I yet in the love of this wicked one, in this ſacrilegious, in this unfaithfull man. He hath deceived one ſiſter, and the other is betraied, or ſlaine: And ought I to have hope on the inſtability of that heart that is inconſtant in inconſtancy it ſelfe. No, no, to retard ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is to render him worſe. Their Errours are to be pardoned who are in a ſtate to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not them to whom forgiveneſſe ſerves as a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169974:70"/>fomentation to worſe. This impious man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſacrifice to the juſtice of my diſdaine.</p>
               <p>Hereupon reſolved to kill him, ſhe moved her arme and directed the dagger towards his heart, as if ſhe meant to puniſh that part firſt, by which firſt ſhe ſuppoſed her ſelfe injured. The arrivall of a Knight, who having obſerved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe Diſcourſes, hindered this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who juſt came in time to hold her hand. Bluſh you not (he ſaid) to defile your ſelfe in the bloud of theſe, who by their habits cannot but be imagined baſe? Art thou of ſo meane a ſpirit, that thou wilt make war againſt perſons that are overcome by ſleep: Or throw away thoſe armes, or truly performe things that may be worthy of thoſe Armes? If thou knew'ſt, anſwered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Cauſes of my Anger thou wouldſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud my reſolution, and be thy ſelfe the Author of their deaths. To take theſe wicked ones out of the world is to do a benefit to the publike. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo wicked may alſo be wickedly puniſhed. Againſt thoſe that are unarmed, replied the other, and thoſe that are aſleep, there is no reaſon that prevailes. It is not lawfull to do amiſſe to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe an errour. Beſides, from ſo meane perſons an injury is not received. They are not ſo preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly onward the firſt as the ruſticity of their Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments figures them to you. He is a Prince, yet unworthy of ſuch a name, and goes peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theſe counterfeit habits to deceive ſome other as he hath done me. So ſaying, ſhe pulled off her Helme, adding: <hi>I</hi> am not a man, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169974:70"/>you thought me. To give a maſſe to my Infelicity, which muſt alwaies accompany me, Nature made me a woman. I gave to this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one my love, my honour. Being growne weary of me, with the very ſame Arts which he had woven ſnares with, to beguile my ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, he betrayed the heart of a ſiſter of mine, who, forſaking the Kingdome, and her Father, would follow him. Satiated alſo with this he hath either abandoned, or ſlaine her, for I ſee him with another woman, and not her, whom he took with him.</p>
               <p>Have not I then reaſon to be cruell againſt the ſoftneſs of my ſex in the iniquity of this impious man. No, <hi>Infanta Ariama,</hi> ſaid <hi>Oleandro,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wakened at their talke, had in ſome part ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her Complaints, and knew her; The abſent ſhould never be condemned. Though I appeare guilty, I am not for all that ſuch. If the benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that <hi>Infanta,</hi> who could give me her heart, would pleaſe to liſten to my words, ſhe ſhould ſee that I am not to be blamed, as the world may believe I am; you ſhould not fixe your ſelfe in the appearance of things. Even <hi>Jove</hi> ſends forth his Lightnings when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is ſerene, and the Sun makes a glorious ſhew of himſelfe ſometimes when a ſhower falls.</p>
               <p>Wicked man, anſwered the <hi>Infanta,</hi> how skilfull thou art to maſcherate thy excuſes! Thy perfidiouſneſſe might move me, if I had not proved the dammages of thy diſloyalty. Tell me, tell me, perfidious man, how thou canſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169974:71"/>colour thy flight? What canſt thou ſay for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of my ſiſter? What moved thee to leave me with a pledge in my belly of thy unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Why didſt thou not take me with thee inſtead of my ſiſter? Faire <hi>Infanta</hi> replied <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro:</hi> One cannot perſwade one that will not be perſwaded. If <hi>I</hi> have ever deceived you, if this heart hath ever produced deſires which are not proper to my faith, and my obligations, if my mind be eſtranged from you, even in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of very dreames, <hi>I</hi> beſeech <hi>Jove</hi> that he come againſt me with all his Lightnings; that <hi>Pluto</hi> make me ſubject to all the torments of his Kingdome; that the Earth may bring forth no other for me but wild beaſts, brambles, and pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that the ſea reſerve for my ſufferings all his <hi>Abyſſes,</hi> and finally, that the aire, uniting all the worſt influences of it, inſtead of affording me breath, may ſtifle me.</p>
               <p>Beleeve Oaths, preſently replied the <hi>Infanta!</hi> He that hath an heart ſo impious that it can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray an Innocent, will alſo have that confidence to deny his treaſon. Wicked man, thy deceits are too ſenſible, which thou haſt contrived to deceive me anew. But <hi>I</hi> will confound thee. <hi>I</hi> will that thy temerity ſhall be loſt amidſt thy own Anſwers. What haſt thou done with my Siſter? Why wentſt thou with her? Why haſt thou couſened her? <hi>Infanta</hi> (anſwered <hi>Olean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>) <hi>I</hi> know not what thing Deceit is. The Princeſs your Siſter, betraying her ſelfe, hath deceived me, and that very ſame day juſt that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169974:71"/>ſhe made me part from <hi>Teſſet, I</hi> by an accident parted from her.</p>
               <p>Here he related point by point the counterfeit Letter, his departure, the company of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Knight, how he came to know her, the words that paſſed, the wound the Princeſſe gave her ſelfe, and divers other particulars: Which being heard with a diſdainefull laughter of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him: <hi>Oleandro,</hi> dreames and fables find no belefe in the mind of a Lover, who hardly can credit her eyes. Are you not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied to have tormented my innocency with your workes, that anew you would with words entice my ſoule from me? See how perfidious, and how cruell thou art. Thou propoſeſt things to me ſo far diſtant from being and poſſibility, that <hi>I</hi> can never enforce my heart to beleeve them. How? Thou receive a Letter and not diſtinguiſh the Characters! A Meſſenger wakened you and you obſerved him not. A Knight accompanied you, and you knew him not. The wounds, the thieves and thy other imaginations raiſe in me that effect which the fragours of the waves of <hi>Nylus</hi> make, which deafen. Thou art ingratefull, thou art a Traitour, thou art a wicked man, and therefore no wonder thou ſhouldſt be a Lyer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who is this that goes along with you a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of your misfortunes? What confidence, what engagement, what meanes rendred thee a Companion ſo intereſſed, that ſhe hath a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as it were, to repoſe her ſelfe in thy boſome, and now, aſſured of thy protection, hath given
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169974:72"/>her ſelfe over a prey to ſleepe?</p>
               <p>This, replied <hi>Oleandro,</hi> is my Siſter, and <hi>I</hi> would that you ſhould underſtand it from her very mouth. So ſpeaking, he awakened <hi>Arnalta,</hi> ſaying to her: Come Siſter and reverence this Lady, whom my heart hath elected for its Queen. Is perhaps this, replied <hi>Arnalta,</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Numidia?</hi> Underſtanding it was the ſame, ſhe ran to kiſſe her hands. The <hi>Infanta</hi> drew them back to her, ſaying, Excuſe me, if Love and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie take from me thoſe actions of Courteſie, which are owing to your merit. To day <hi>I</hi> ſhould rejoyce to be deceived, becauſe <hi>I</hi> might beguile my feare. <hi>I</hi> have buſineſſe of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with this, whom you affirme to be your brother. <hi>I</hi> can neither anſwer, nor live if <hi>I</hi> ſee not the end of this. Turning her ſelfe then to <hi>Oleandro,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him: <hi>I</hi> cannot deny but that thy Lies carry a face of truth: But this time they ſhall not find credit; I will yeeld to your aſsertion, that this is your Siſter; But how will you prove that performed which you have fabled of me? Innocency, readily replied <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro,</hi> hath not need of many proofes. Behold the Letter which the Princeſs <hi>Arelida,</hi> your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, made uſe of to deceive me. Take notice of your own Characters ſo well imitated, that I believe you your ſelfe would remaine in doubt that your hand had faſhioned them unknown to your eyes and heart. Then ſaid the <hi>Infanta,</hi> Is <hi>Oleandro</hi> faithfull? Then is he mine. O Gods, what thankes can I ever render you, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169974:72"/>me my Lover on better conditions then I could deſire or imagine?</p>
               <p>She ranne after to embrace him: neither the preſence of <hi>Arnalta,</hi> nor that of the other Knight could containe her in thoſe tenderneſſes which are practis'd onely among Lovers. Their kiſſes were centuplicated. Their Arms which as it were ſtrove with their hearts in expreſſing Affection, were not wearie with Embracing, as much as might be they endeavoured to unite their bodies.</p>
               <p>The heart not being able for joy to contain it ſelf in the breaſt, iſſued out of it in words kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and teares. In ſumme, there was not a ſenſe in them which rejoyced not. Theſe firſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of Affection being over-paſſed, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed themſelves, he with the Knight, and ſhe with <hi>Arnalta;</hi> they reſolved preſently to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence, not to be over-taken by the night. The Knight told them, that not farre off there was an houſe where they need not deſire wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. They took their way towards it. <hi>Olsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> entreated the <hi>Infanta</hi> to make the tediouſneſs and troubles of their journey, pleaſant with ſome Relation, he being deſirous of the newes that fell out in the Court after his departure with the Princeſſe. The <hi>Infanta</hi> with an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs encountring this occaſion, thus began her Storie.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT was two houres day when the Damſels of the Princeſs my Siſter perceived, that ſhee was miſſing. More by their teares then words they acquainted my father with it. At the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, he became ſpeechleſſe. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent without delay to the Ports, to learne whither ſhe took her voiage, diſpatching every way ſouldiers on Horſeback to ſtay her. Hee imagined ſhe was gone with you, the Guards of the Golden gate reporting your Departure with one Companion, who by the Deſcription they made could not but be my ſiſter. When I knew it, I was willing to die for griefe, I ſaid and did things which would have provoked ſenſe of Pity, even in things inſenſible. My Father hearing no tidings of her could not be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and removed ſome Moneths without ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe to be ſeen in publick.</p>
               <p>In that time the Prince his Brother returned from warre, maintained alwayes at great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges abroad, becauſe being cruell of nature, and a Lover of innovation, my Father very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſaw him not in the Kingdome. Hee was ſcarce come, but he deſired leave to depart for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> by Fame enflamed with love to the Princeſs <hi>Dianea,</hi> who for Beauty was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a new <hi>Venus.</hi> My Father whom theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours pleaſed not for Reaſons of State, would not conſent to him: for many times their Of-ſpring
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169974:73"/>engage Parents to great Matters, and 'tis ſmall ſecurity to a Prince that many may pretend to the Government. My Uncle ſhew'd himſelfe not to care for this denyall, eſpecially becauſe a few dayes before the Nuptials of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> with the King of <hi>Armenia's</hi> youngeſt Sonne were there publiſhed, He fixed his minde and thought on new objects. He eſteemed the Dutcheſs of <hi>Corana</hi> worthy his affections. There he applyed himſelfe with ſuch a Paſſion, that he made all the Court admire him, ſeeing a Prince a Rivall to <hi>Mars,</hi> become ſuddenly a Tributary to <hi>Cupid.</hi> Many times an alteration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Extreames is Eaſie. My Father neither allow'd of, nor withſtood theſe Amours, feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe blinde in things perſpicuous to all. The Dutcheſs, (although Ambition, and a deſire to be beloved be connaturals to women) ſeemed ſtrange altogether and coy at it.</p>
               <p>She had formerly engaged her heart to <hi>Doar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> the Count of <hi>Naſace,</hi> a Knight, who by the gentleneſs of his behaviour, and the valour of his ſword, had gained himſelfe the Affections of all. Shee truely had never applyed her minde thither, if my intereſt had not induced her. The ſeeing me ſo neare to render account to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the pleaſures I had ſtole from my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, made her fall into a Reſolution far from her opinion and genius. We two onely could not conceale, nor mature the birth with ſafety. There was need of many ſhadowes to darken ſo many eyes. The Count was made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169974:74"/>with my ſecrets; the Dutcheſs veiling the Neceſſity under an apparance of truſt. He that was repleat with good Nature and kindneſſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelfe to ſerve me in all that which was knowne to be able to exerciſe his devotion, and make triall of his heart.</p>
               <p>Theſe Motives enforced the Dutcheſs to ſlight the Affections of the Prince. He that took more fire out of theſe ſtrangeneſſes, left not any means unattempted to winne her: Entreaties, Meſſengers, Letters and Preſents came daily from him. She neither with refuſing, nor accepting all, endeavoured to conquer obſtination with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination. He continually beſieged our lodgings, and the Dutcheſs was many times conſtrained to talk to him with affection in deſpight of her will, to keep him at diſtance from us. He often times having required my aſſiſtance, I evermore with greater earneſtneſſe diſſwaded him from it. I made him ſee how much he deceived himſelfe, that pretended love from her that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not, or from her that would not love. That there was no force that had power to bow our affections: The divinity of our minde not to be lyable to violence; The heart of a Woman to be moved like the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> onely by it ſelfe, with a Motion contrary to others. The Merit of that man to be undervalued which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to be beloved without love, loves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being beloved. That Prayers and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions beget not love, but foment Ambition in Women, who diſdaine the pooreneſſe of that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169974:74"/>ſpirit which cannot deſpiſe, being deſpiſed. They account him unworthy of affection, that cannot reſent injuries.</p>
               <p>Theſe notwithſtanding were conſiderations which made him deſpaire, but eas'd him not of his love. Conſtant in his Reſolutions he try'd all wayes. To this end he employed all the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Court, which he dayly by entreaties and gifts won him. They were all engaged to ſerve him, gain'd by ſo many kindneſſes, that they durſt not contradict him. The hope of the Princeſſe Favour prevailes much more in them, (and the greater part of ſervants are ſo) then the duty of their place and faith. In particular, he had obtained the good will of <hi>Theraſia,</hi> of bloud leſſe then ordinary, a Damſell belonging to the Dutcheſs: but one that had gained by the Merits of a ſingular beauty, and with an aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous applying her ſelfe to her Ladies ſervice that place. This in ſuch a wiſe poſſeſſed the minde of the Dutcheſſe, that ſhe held her worthy to know my ſecrets, neglecting all others that waited on me. She would firſt have believed the heavens corruptible, then this heart, to which without doubt ſhe had given more truſt then ſhe did to her owne.</p>
               <p>To this the Prince applyed his minde; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that to tempt her thoſe wayes, whereby he prevailed upon others, would be in vaine, hee won her with a new ſtratagem. With ſo much cunning he feigned himſelfe in love with her, that ſhee ſo eaſily believed him in it, that he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169974:75"/>needed not enforce himſelfe farther to make her underſtand it. The Title of faire, that was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by all, made her grow proud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſhe ſhould caſt her Lady out of the Princes affection, more eſpecially becauſe ſhe knew ſhe was engaged in another love, and would not, nor could not pleaſe him. The Prince one day eſpying her in the Garden, when ſhe was alone, took hold of the oceaſion, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak to her.</p>
               <p>Faire Lady, I ſhould not deſerve your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſhewing my ſelfe inconſtant. But I ſhould be neither a Man, nor Prince, if I knew not how to ſlight, where I am deſpis'd. Your Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were ordinary if it had not the power to ſubject to you the glories of others. I have loved the Dutcheſs, I confeſſe it, nor can I deny it, you may have reaſon to ſuſpect me falſe in my ſecond loves, when you have found me incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in my firſt. Now I ſo exceſſively affect you, that I believe I ſhould loſe my ſelfe, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining me to be without you. Argue then what the ardour of that heart muſt be which knew how to love even one that did not deſerve love. He that can burne in Froſt, what will he do in fire? You have not reaſon to refuſe me. I am a Prince, and brother to the King. Although theſe hands ſway not the Scepter, they deſerve it: and 'tis the glory of vertue to be underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by Fortune. You cannot aſpire to an higher greatneſſe: nor your beautie receive a larger Adoration, then that of an heart that knowes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169974:75"/>it ſelfe ſuperiour to all things. The Dutcheſſes Refuſals ought not to provoke yours. The Sun is not in fault, though ſome blaſpheme and deſpiſe it, much leſs doth it loſe the ſplendor of its Beames, becauſe Batts and Howlets abhorre the light of it. The Gods peradventure will puniſh ſome Crime of hers, by rendring her a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of the favours of Deſtinie. They corrupt the judgements of thoſe, for whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare puniſhment. I ſhould ſay more, if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie of your Beauties could receive a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion from words. It ſufficeth, that you know I love you. A ſoule as faire as your face knows as well to correſpond to affection, as it to make it ſelfe beloved. I adde no more, becauſe I deſire you may love my Affection, not my Voice; Who intreats either demerits or Diſtruſts. But your gentleneſs ſecures me both from the one and the other.</p>
               <p>Here the Prince my Uncle ſtopp'd, fixing his eyes on her, who had loved him before then, if ſhe had not accuſed ſo ambitious an Affection of raſhneſs, or if he before had diſcovered to her the leaſt ſigne of his. <hi>Theraſia,</hi> imitating the uſuall Cuſtomes of women, to cloath their Deſires with Diſſimulation, altering her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with a feigned bluſh, conterfeiting a mixture of joy and ſorrow, after a ſhort ſilence, thus anſwered:</p>
               <p>Prince, I cannot deny but that I beleeve you love me: For notwithſtanding that there are not in me conditions to deſerve your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169974:76"/>I have for all that an ambition to wiſh it. Impoſſibility hath not a difficulty for thoſe that earneſtly covet it. I can much leſſe ſay I love you not, ſince in my countenance you may read the Affections of my heart. It is our duty to love our Princes; and it is a ſtupidity not to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond to thoſe that love us. But for all that, that I infinitely love you, I cannot but put you in minde of thoſe things in the which the affection I beare you, obligeth me, although they may prejudice me. You are Prince, and if the Laws of deſert were not regulated by thoſe of Fortune ſhould be King. To ſubmit then to Nuptialls ſo inferiour to your birth, I know not what it may be thought on by the world, or how endured by your ſelfe. As I have Moderation to content my ſelfe with my owne Fortune, I ſhould not ſo have patience for the Precipices of your forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me. If you love me Prince, doe not with exalting me expoſe me more to the Lightnings. It ſerves for a glory to deſerve Entreaties from him, who ſhould not know how to beſeech me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting by the ſlighteſt ſignes from him to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. Now I will believe the adulations of Lovers true, ſince my beauties, though ſomething leſſe then ordinary, have been priviledged by your election and commendation. But may it pleaſe your Highneſs to know, I have no will, that ſhall not be ſubordinate to your Commands. And that I feare not infelicity, ſo it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed by your deſires, and by your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169974:76"/>
                  <hi>Theraſia</hi> ſeal'd up her anſwer with a deep court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey. The Prince receiving heat from theſe repulſes that invited him, after ſome Reply he promiſed her marriage, and expreſs'd a great earneſtneſs to get out of her the cauſes which had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Dutcheſs refuſals. <hi>Theraſia,</hi> willing to gaine her ſelfe an higher place in the Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, made uſe of infidelity to authenticate her faith; She recounted to him the Amours of the Dutcheſs with the Count of <hi>Naſaos,</hi> with all thoſe particulars that might render true her deſigne; Yet ſhe made no mention of me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, <hi>I</hi> know not, whether by feare or by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The Prince, joyfull to have accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his ends, with divers gifts (among others a Jewell of pearle, in the which all the Gods were wrought) diſmiſt her. My Uncle perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe he could not eaſier beguile the heart of <hi>Theraſia</hi> than by enterpoſing the duties to her. He thought ſhe could take no ſuſpition of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery whileſt ſhe had the Gods witneſſes.</p>
               <p>She returned in that time to our Lodgings, when I was halfe dead, oppreſſed by the paines of Child-birth. When I had remained about an houre in the hands of death, I was delivered of a daughter, which encreaſed my afflictions. It was ſo like you, that to deny it yours were to ſtrive againſt the judgement of all eyes. I had ſcarce time to looke on it but it was taken from me, the Dutcheſſe fearing the crying of it would diſcover my errours. I had no power to oppoſe my ſelfe, for being overcome by weakneſſe, I
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169974:77"/>had no force left me but in lamentation. It was took away by a Gentleman of the Court, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it a child of one of my Damſels. The Count not being willing, in a buſineſſe of ſuch conſequence, to truſt to the faith of any other. My Father and the Phyſitians were deceived in the knowledge of my diſeaſe, whereupon there were not any that ſuſpected. In a few daies I mended, filling the Court with comfort that ſighed for my recovery.</p>
               <p>In the meane while the Prince my Uncle vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting daily the retirings of <hi>Theraſia,</hi> though he yet counterfeited with the Dutcheſſe, put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome feare. But on the other ſide he had the praiſes which <hi>Theraſia</hi> beſtowed upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Prince, though ſhe had formerly been wont to blame his inſolency. The ſignes of her mind to perceive her cold in her ſervice to her Lady, and full of diſdaine and pride to other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Court confirmed me. All motives that enforced me to obſerve her when ſhe was alone in her Chamber. One day I perceived that ſhe talked to a Picture all beſet with Jewels; Her words were all of affection, although they arrived not all diſtinctly to my eare, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of the Picture was ſuddenly known by me to be the Princes my Uncles.</p>
               <p>Upon that, with a violence forcing the doores, I came upon her before ſhe had time to lay by the Picture. Injuries accompanied the haſtineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of my diſdaine, ſo much the more furious by how much the more reaſonable. I ſnatched it out
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169974:77"/>of her hand with ſpeeches as ſevere as could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a mouth which invenomed the words to render them more offenſive. Her excuſes were abundant, attended on by ſo many teares, that in my doubts they made me more conſuſed. For ſhe inſiſted alwaies with invocating all the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of heaven, that ſhe had not told any thing of me. She ſaid, ſhe had done amiſſe not to do amiſſe. That ſhe could not help her Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring her ſelfe. Being elected by the Prince for his Spouſe, ſhe could notbut obey him. Divers things ſhe ſaid, and if I would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her had ſpoke of more. I found not a greater alteration in my life. To be ſilent with hope that others will be ſo, is difficult and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. <hi>Theraſia</hi> offended by my rebukes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies under the ſhadow of my anger, was not to be contained within her duty. I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe truſt in her whom I had injured, and in whoſe heart the favours of the Dutcheſſe could find no fidelity. What chaſtiſement ought not <hi>I</hi> to feare from the King my Father, ſince (though mine were concealed) <hi>I</hi> had given aſſiſtance and aſſent to the Amours of the Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>My Father would not that the Riches of the Dutcheſs ſhould foment the ſpirits of any to aſpire to the diſturbance of the Kingdome. He had many times expreſsed himſelfe to me, he would feigne penetrate into the thought of the Dutcheſs, to know whither her heart aimed. He knew her of a Family that had ever made the Kings jealous. Her Father for this purpoſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169974:78"/>the ſpecies of honour, was maintained out of the Kingdome, and mine accounted not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſafe till he had heard news of his death. Theſe conſiderations in ſuch wiſe poſseſsed my mind, that a great part of the night was ſpent before <hi>I</hi> came out of <hi>Theraſia</hi>'s Chamber. In this while the Dutcheſs came in, and with a great deale of alteration related to me, that the Prince, meeting with the Count, that came to viſit her, intending to aſsault him, was ſlaine by him, with many wounds in his breaſt, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him leave to uſe any imaginable defence, for feare others ſhould ſtir in his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Prince informed by <hi>Theraſia</hi> of the Counts walkes, had waited many times to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him. I having been weake retarded this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in him: for keeping my bed, the Dutcheſs with other Ladies, were neceſſitated to attend me. But <hi>I</hi> being recovered he reſolved to effect it, and it had ſucceeded if he had made uſe of his hands before his tongue. The Count had hardly ſuffered the Prince to call him Traitour, but knowing him by his voice he ſtuck his Iron in his breaſt. My Uncle would have ſaid I am ſlaine, but the effects preceded his words, for he ſaid nothing but I am. The Count came preſently to acquaint the Dutcheſſe with this, and perſwaded her to make ready to be gone, whileſt he would expect her untill day at the ſhore in one of the ſtrongeſt Veſſels, not having any thing to be his hinderance, the Ports and the Guards of the Sea being committed to his cuſtody.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:169974:78"/>
               <p>This new Accident I perfected in my thoughts to make me maddiſh I gave my ſelfe over to the aggravation of my miſeries with ſo much ſenſs, that I imagined I felt all my paſt evills. Then (ſaid I) ſhall I evermore be tyrannized over by Fortune? Then to ſatiate the appetites of my ſenſe, ſhall I every day be unhappy? Then thoſe many favours that I have received from chance, in being a Princeſſe of ſuch a Kingdome, have done nothing but moleſt me! Dutcheſs, I will dye; with great reaſon it was ſaid, that our felicity remaines in our hands, ſince by killing our ſelves we may make our ſelves happy. And what hope can longer entertain me in life? A Lover, to whom I have given the liberty of my heart, abandons me. A Siſter, whom I loved equall to my ſelfe, hath betrayed me. A Father, in the tenderneſſe of whoſe affections I can have no deſire but it will obtaine its end, hath been wronged by me in his reputation and honour; and ſhall I live! Who counſels me to it loves me not; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be tormented then may live. All things are determined with life; and who lives not cannot at all languiſh.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs, although in a worſe condition than I, did not leave to comfort me. She told me deſpaire was the laſt of evills, and that to do ſo was undecent in all, but moſt blameable in them that ſhould have greater hearts than miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; who will triumph over Fortune (ſhe ſaid) muſt let it run how it pleaſe. Thoſe waies are too baſe for a Princeſs that are even practiſed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169974:79"/>by Slaves. The greatneſs of your ſpirit ſhould not ſubmit to ſuch ordinary Paragons, which conſiſts in ſuſtaining ill encounters, not in flying them; ſhew the bravery of your mind in living in deſpite of Chance, A Lover hath forſaken you, becauſe he was unworthy of you; You will find a thouſand others of them that will ſigh for the favour of your looks; you ought to comfort your ſelfe, thanking the Gods that an immodeſt ſiſter hath got from you an unfaithfull Lover. She could not do you a greater ſervice than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move far from you thoſe dangers which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a heart that deceives. Beſides, you could not have wiſhed her a greater puniſhment than the fellowſhip of ſo perfidious a ſervant. If you have trangreſſed againſt the ſatisfactions of your Father, the fault is Loves, which eaſily renders all errours excuſable. Will you then after you have offended him in opinion (for Reputation, Honour, and Fame are for all things) offend him alſo in ſenſe, deprive him of a great part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by being your own murtherer? You lament that you have offended him in an imaginary thing, &amp; will you redouble the injury, making him mad by killing your ſelfe? To go for ſome time far from hence will be the beſt, now too when we have an honourable invitation; We may retire our ſelves to your Aunt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where with greater ſecurity we may make our defences. To truſt to an angred Prince, though he be a Father, is not a ſafe determination.</p>
               <p>She added ſo many other reaſons, and ſo many
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169974:79"/>entreaties, that <hi>I,</hi> rather overcome than perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, made ready for a departure. <hi>Theraſia</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Princes death, and my reſolution, ſeeing that to deſpaire was the only remedy for her miſeries, ſtuck her ſelfe two or three times into the breaſt with a Stiletto, without any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being able to prevent her. The Dutcheſs, that knew not the cauſe, had become diſtracted, but that <hi>I,</hi> briefly informing her, of what was paſt, made her caſt aſide that pitty, which truly ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a chance deſerved. Opening <hi>Theraſias</hi> Chamber doore, <hi>I</hi> retired into my Lodgings, where taking thoſe Jewels which were of leaſt weight and greateſt price, arming me to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit my Sexe, and the Dutcheſs being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled like a Page, we went to the Sea-ſide; For there was nothing that hindred us.</p>
               <p>There finding the Count, that ſtay'd for us, we went aboard the beſt Galley of the Kingdome, and doubling the Slaves we put the Oars to the water: whiles it ſeemed that the ſea with an un-before-ſeene tranquility emulated the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. We directed our voyage in the <hi>Atlanticks</hi> towards <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Queen my Aunt. Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire failed us, for being willing to ſhun a fleet of two hundred ſaile, we went far into the ſea, ſo that being ſurpriſed by a Tempeſt, it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to reach Land. Being toſt a fortnight by the waves and winds, we were alwaies in danger to be caſt away. But the goodneſſe of the Veſſell, and the ſtrength of the Rowers brought us at laſt to ſhore in an Iſland unknown,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169974:80"/>even to the Marriners themſelves. We were in that ſtate we could not have continued longer, not only all things neceſſary for life, but alſo for a voyage being ſpent. Our haſt to depart allowed us not time to make that proviſion, which the Navigation of a ſea inexorable to all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>Being disbarqued in the Iſland, whileſt the Rowers made proviſion of Wood and Water, we walked a little forward to ſeeke out lodging. The incommodities of our voyage made us deſire to find an houſe to repoſe us in without trouble and feare. In aſcending a little hill we diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome buildings, which, made in forme of a Pallace, ſerved alſo for a Fortreſſe. We preſently went thitherward, where we were received with very great kindneſſe. Two Ladies of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Age came to meet us, and with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny welcomes offered us Lodging, that we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted words to expreſs ſo great Obligations. They were waited on by many Damzels, one of the which ſuppoſing me a man, began to look on me with ſo much affection, that I took no ordinary pleaſure at it, telling the Count and Dutcheſs of it that they might hold their tongues; I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed my ſelfe to her with ſo much love, that I perſwaded my ſelfe ſhe would grow mad. But afterwards I repented me of it, remembring me that I was not in the condition to cure her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. Though we endeavoured to underſtand the quality and the name of the Iſland, we could get no anſwer to purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:169974:80"/>
               <p>Supper time being come, my Favourite the Damſell found opportunity to ſay to me: Faire Knight, theſe wicked women lay ſnares for your lives. Within a few houres you will either be ſlaine, or made a Priſoner. I that take compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the beauty of your face, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your yeares, have thought it expedient with danger to my ſelf to releaſe you from yours. They intend to ſet before you meats mingled with <hi>Opium</hi> to ſeize on you with the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But being retired to your appointed Lodgings, make uſe of this Preſervative, which ſhall preſerve you from their treacheries. So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe gave me a little pot full of a certaine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt ſleepy poyſons; Afterwards added, Since I adventure my life to do you this favour, I deſire no other reward but your love, which I would enjoy flying with you hence from places ſo impious. I then grown extreamely fearefull promiſed her more than I could performe; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting an Obligation to her, not to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Ages. The meat came up, of which I taſted ſo ſparingly, that I even did nothing but talke. The Tables being removed our Quarters were aſſigned us. We feigning our ſelves weary preſently bad good-night to thoſe that waited on us, and I revealed to the Count and Dutcheſſe the Damzels ſecret; we tooke the Preſervative with ſo much feare of being ſurprized, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little noiſe made us believe it was Souldiers that ſhould aſſault us. All the ſoporiferous poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the world would not then have had the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169974:81"/>power to have made us ſleep in that feare.</p>
               <p>Halfe the night being paſt the Damzell came to call us, we followed her with all poſſible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie, who through a private gate led us forth of the Pallace. There mounting upon foure horſes which were provided by the Damzell for that purpoſe, we began our journey, riding apace: We would have taken the way to the ſea, but our Guide permitted us not, ſaying, that were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter dangers inſtead of flying them: For all thoſe ſhores were prey'd upon by the owners of that houſe, ſo impious and ſo cruell, that they rejoyced not in their Booties unleſs they were defiled with bloud. The remnant of that night, and almoſt all the day after, we proſecuted our journey, perpetually moleſted by that Damzell with ſo much earneſtneſs as if ſhe had perceived Enemies following us at hand.</p>
               <p>I being no longer able to endure the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of riding, the night approaching, would ſtay in a Village; the rather becauſe the people there told us the way was dangerous in the night time, eſpecially being frequented by wild beaſts and thieves. Having reſted me there a little, I entreated the Damzell with much vehemency to recount to us the cruelty of that houſe, which (her gentleneſs aſſiſting) we had avoided. She after ſuch a bluſh (as if her modeſty came forth with it, or rather as if with the purple of her face ſhe meant to cover the blackneſs of her heart) thus anſwered:</p>
               <p>Sirs, If to excuſe errours under the Pretext of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169974:81"/>love was not uſuall to all, eſpecially women; I ſhould call that tongue raſh, which ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the boldneſſe to to maſcherate the Dotages of the minde. But acknowledging my ſelfe a Lover, I deſerve all pardon. Love is pictur'd blinde, becauſe he makes blinde: And the falls of a blinde body are to be borne withall, and compaſſionated. I hardly faſtned mine eyes on your Countenance (faire Knight) but they felt the Chaſtiſement for their raſhneſſe; it being not lawfull, without prejudice to the heart to penetrate into the Paradice of your Beautie. Becomming a Lover, and knowing the unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Deſcent, I deſpaired of the end. I betook me to Deceit, which triumphs many times over all things. To perſwade your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I feign'd thoſe things I ſaid, the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine no other truth but that of my flames.</p>
               <p>If you have ever had experience of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of affection, I hope you may well beare with me. But if you have never felt the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of it, believe me, untill your owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhall bring you a certainty of it, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this in your good diſpoſition, will not be imputed as a fault to me; becauſe every thing is lawfull to thoſe that love. Beſides, if there be any due, it is your beautie that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth puniſhment, which hath been able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the ſimplicity of my heart to deceit.</p>
               <p>I was moved at one time by theſe words to Compaſſion and Anger. It vexed me to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted upon ſo uncivill tearmes from that houſe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169974:82"/>where there was nothing but Honours prepared for me. But this Damſels ſo very extream affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it merited pardon, pacified me: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I thus anſwered her:</p>
               <p>Lady, Whoſoever hath been a Lover can doe no other but compaſſionate you. I that have been in love, know how to excuſe you: For the firſt thing that pardons Lovers, is the intellect, and reaſon. It much afflicts me, that to beguile us you have deceived your ſelfe, in beſtowing your Affections on a Perſon who can exchange nothing with you but affection. I would to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven I were in as good a Condition to correſpond with you, as I am willing to pitty you. I am a Woman as you are, but more unhappy then you, becauſe I have not loved ſo as you. If I had encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my thought to love a woman, I had eſcaped the Aſſaults of Fortune. Comfort your ſelfe; for you may receive profit, if not delight from your affection.</p>
               <p>The Damſell recover'd not at theſe words; for ſorrow having deprived her of her ſenſes, rendred her inſenſible even to ſorrow it ſelfe. After a while comming to her ſelfe, ſhe faigned ſhe was well ſatisfied: whereupon I left her in bed, whilſt wanting reſt, I deſired with a little Repoſe to eaſe me after theſe paſſed troubles. At our awaking in the Morning, we found that the Damſell was gone. Being hopeleſſe at the impoſſibilitie of her Affections, ſhe will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome new Reſolution, of whom hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have had no tidings. We blaming the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169974:82"/>Deceits of ſo fooliſh a Wench went towards the Sea, to finde out our Galley. After much Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes we were aflaulted by foure Theeves. One of them ſuddainly ſeized on the Dutcheſſe, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her ſo ſwiftly up ſome certaine Crages of the Mountaines, that it was impoſſible for me to accompany her with my ſight. The others came and aſſaulted us, not thinking to finde much reſiſtance in us, they being more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Count unable to endure that his eyes ſhould aſſiſt to the loſſe of his heart, with three blowes ſlew two of them, and wounded the third, in ſuch manner, that he could no longer defend himſelfe. Without delay, he went in ſearch of his ſoule, ſtolne away by that thiefe from him. I gave the wounded one his life, on condition he would guide me to the Dutcheſs. He promiſed me; but being mounted on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, I having no time to hinder him, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly betook himſelfe to flight.</p>
               <p>Remaining alone in ſome Paſſion, becauſe the Night already had covered the Heaven with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Darkneſſe, I tired my voice in reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the names of the Dutcheſſe and Count. The Caves moved to pitty at my Callings, to caſe me of labour, replyed in many places, or rather the Aire ſo many times ſtruck wearied with hearing me, to make me hold my peace, iterated often times what I ſaid. I had the chance to meet with ſome Shepheards, who with courteſies not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practized by great ones, made me envy their Genius, if not their Fortune. Four dayes
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169974:83"/>I continued among them with hope to heare Newes of the Count and Dutcheſſe. One mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I departed from thoſe Cottages, with an intent to goe to the Sea, and ſo to be tranſported into <hi>Egypt.</hi> I eaſily miſſed the way taught me by the Shepheards, and have therefore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred many dayes up and downe theſe Fields in danger of my life. Fortunate Errors, happy dangers, ſince they have guided me to you, who are the End, whither my Troubles and my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes doe aſpire.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaid, the <hi>Infanta Ariama,</hi> when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Pallace where they meant to ſty. It was ſituated in a Plaine, and raviſhed the eyes of Paſſengers, no leſſe by the Majeſty then the beauty of it. The Architecture was Dorick, and the out-ſides of fine Marble. It was encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed round by an infinite number of Cypreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, ſet in ſo good order, and ſo proportionately diſtant one from another, that looked upon either directly or traverſely, they could not beiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the leaſt irregular. They of the Pallace ſcarce perceived they were come, but two Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in mourning habit, brought them a welcome from the Lady of the Houſe. They eaſily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves to receive it, when neceſſity could not afford them other lodging, neither more neare, nor more commodious. With a large expreſſion they thanked the Gallantry of that Lady, who was willing to oblige them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe knew them, and followed the Damſels unto the gates of the Court.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:169974:83"/>
               <p>In their Entrance, at the firſt ſight they were terrified: In the midſt of it was placed a Statue of Revenge. Yet was it not believed a Statue but by thoſe that could offend it without being offended. It was figured in the likeneſſe of an armed Woman, with a flame of fire upon her Helmet. In her right hand ſhe held a Dagger, and at her feet a Lion. It ſpoke not, with-held peradventure by Scorne that kept her words in; or rather bindred by biting a finger of her left hand. On the ſides of the Hall all the moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Loves of the world were delineated. There was ſeen <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> pierced with the ſame ſword, breathe out their ſouls; and the feigned bloud which they ſhed, had the vertue to beget true teares. <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Hero,</hi> the one deſtroyed by the waters of the Sea, and the other by thoſe of her eyes, in ſuch wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Oleandro</hi> and his Companions, as if only then by chance they had been deſtinated to death. There was alſo <hi>Medea,</hi> through <hi>Jaſons</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, growne ſo cruell to kill her Children, having firſt, enforced by love, ſlain her brother. The poore <hi>Ariadne</hi> complained on a Rock, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her haire, and beating her breaſt. Her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations arrived not to the eares of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, carried farre away by the windes, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed by the Waves: or rather by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming become hoarſe, ſhe had not the ſtrength left to make her ſelfe heard.</p>
               <p>In briefe, a thouſand were the Objects which entertained in ſuſpence the ſtrangers, when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169974:84"/>by the Damſels, they aſcended the ſtairs. At the top of which, they were met by a Lady, who for being all attired in black, could not be imagined any thing but night, with a blacke veile ſhe held her eyes covered, for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be thought night, ſhe would not permit thoſe two Suns to be ſeene, which ſhe carried in her eyes. After ſhe had received and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ſalutation, ſhe ſaid: I am ſorry, O Sirs, you are come to funerallize your ſelves in the miſeries of this Houſe. The Neceſſity that conſtraines you to ſtay here, pleads it ſelfe my Excuſe. I wiſh only I knew your firſt Fortunes, that I might ſerve you conformably to the Merit of your preſence.</p>
               <p>Here taking <hi>Ariama</hi> and <hi>Arnalta</hi> by the hand, ſhe led them into other Chambers, requeſting from them the Information of the State of thoſe Knights of their condition, and of their births. Although the <hi>Infanta Ariama</hi> concealed her ſelf ſhe was well knowne by the Lady of the Houſe, who leaving her to reſt her ſelfe, went from her to command preparations for Supper. The time being come, they were call'd to it. The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment was handſome, but not ſtately. The ſtrangers eate little, or wearie of travailing, or ſadded by the continuall lamentation of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, who ſeaſoned the meats with her tears.</p>
               <p>When Supper was ended, at a ſigne ſhe gave, the Damſels brought forth ſome glaſſe Bottles, with a certaine Drinke in them, which ſhe ſaid. would enlighten the heart. All of them taſted
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169974:84"/>of them. <hi>Oleandro</hi> in particular dranke more of it then the others, adding; That thoſe ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes had much need of Preſervatives. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turning to the Lady of the houſe, he ſaid, Madam, the Gods have made contraries to be to all things. There are Antidotes, and the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Bees have ſtings, and honey; whereupon there is not any thing in the world, but by the reaſon of Contraries hath a Remedy. Such I hope your Evill may be. If the Affection of an heart, and the ſtrength of a ſword can prevaile with you, to lay aſide this ſorrow; be merry, for I offer my ſelfe to ſerve you. That Countenance which is a Heaven of Beauty, deſerveth not a perpetuall night. Teares ſhould not be permitted to thoſe eyes, which can make happy with their looks. Here <hi>Oleandro</hi> was ſilet, and the Lady thus anſwered:</p>
               <p>Knight, I would to Heaven I had never ſpoke. From the tongue and heart, my infelicities have had Originall. But now there is no longer need to conceale them <hi>Infanta Ariama,</hi> and you Prince <hi>Oleandro,</hi> you are dead, having drunk poiſon in the laſt Bottle. I grieve I was not able to ſacrifice you with a ſwod to Revenge. I rejoyce, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Fortune hath deliver'd you together into my hands. I can no longer ſuppoſe my ſelfe unhappy, ſince I have had this part of felicity, to ſee I am revenged before I dye. You ſhall not depart triumphant from the miſeries of the Princeſſe <hi>Arelida.</hi> I am the very ſame, who lived till now, onely to kill you. <hi>Oleandro,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169974:85"/>he began to feele the effects of the drink, provoked by the out-ragies, which are begot in a breaſt, offended more for the harmes of others, then his owne Danger, ſaid to her:</p>
               <p>Guilty woman, Then becauſe I would not condiſcend to the diſhoneſt of your Deſires, haſt thou condemned me to death? Then wilt thou take away my life, becauſe I have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thy Reputation and Honour. From ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne a minde could not proceed but execrable Effects. Who is impudent is cruell: and who betraies their honeſty to pleaſe their ſenſe, will much leſſe pardon the innocencie of thoſe that will not be blemiſhed with uncleaneneſſes. Did it not ſatisfie thee (perfidious one) to have with thy deceits, contrived Miſeries againſt my happineſſe, that alſo thou haſt intended to heap thy Barbariſmes on this body, a miſerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of the Inconſtancies of Fortune. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, wicked, Sacrilegious, what Reward, what Hope, what Madneſſe, makes thee cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of my bloud; the more undeſerving the Furies of thy wickedneſſe, by reaſon it hath no faults which can convince it of realty? But if this life ought to be ſacrificed to the ſatisfactions of thy Scorne, why do you not pardon thoſe who in the very Fantaſmes of night have not thought to offend you. In what hath your Siſter treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, and mine, with this poore Knight, who is deſign'd to die, onely becauſe he is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Poore <hi>Oleandro!</hi> ſo ſurrounded with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169974:85"/>unhappineſses, that even the guiltleſs ſuffer with me. My Miſeries are contagious, ſince they trench on thoſe that keep mee company. The Gods be praiſed, that hereafter my life cannot infelicitate any. People of <hi>Morocco</hi> here your hopes determine: your Prince is compelled to dye; and ſo much the more diſcontented, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he falls by the hand of a woman, and ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt.</p>
               <p>The Knight, that untill now was unknowne, at theſe words cryed out; Oh Gods! What allow you me to ſee in the laſt day of my life! I ſhould ſay I dyed happily, dying in the preſence of my Prince, if he then might have continued living. What Marvailes, what Portents doth Deſtinie repreſent me? 'Tis true, the ſight of a Prince ſo much beloved, deſerved not to be gain'd without the loſſe of my life. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fortune haſt thou been willing to funerallize to me theſe ſweetneſſes, I ſeeing him dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can ſufficiently embrace him. So ſaying, he made himſelfe knowne to <hi>Oleandro</hi> to be <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,</hi> the Count of <hi>Olano</hi> his Subject; he that with imminent hazard to his owne life, had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him from the Treacheries of thoſe who had uſurped his Crown.</p>
               <p>This interview redoubled their afflictions, ſo that in deſpight of the bravery of their hearts, the teares ranne from their eyes: which would not defraud Death of ſorrows ow'd to ſo worthy Perſonages. <hi>Oleandro</hi>'s vertue remaining hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to invincible againſt all Accidents, had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169974:86"/>againſt the force of Deſtiny, which to render death more noiſome to him, multiply'd thoſe Objects that were able to diſquiet him. There was nothing heard but ſighes, weepings &amp; ſobs. Not an Object to be looked on, but preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſorrow. All was horror, and every body car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried fear and death in their Countenances. There was not a face but it was ſpread with a paleneſs, ſo mortall, that it augmented Affliction in the eyes of all. <hi>Oleandro</hi> at length in deſpight of griefe, ſaid to the Count;</p>
               <p>Friend, it pierces my ſoule, that it was For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes Will to communicate to you my miſeries, becauſed ſee you too much intereſſed in them through your Affection to me. The Gods reward you for it. I am ſo unhappy that I cannot as much as ſuffer for you. The Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death increaſe upon me, ſeeing I muſt die, without being able to recompence the atteſtations of your Faith. If the Lawes of Friendſhip and Obligation preſerve their authority even among Spirits, I hope you ſhall not have occaſion to repent your ſelfe for having loved me.</p>
               <p>Hee would have added more, but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Infanta</hi> began to ſhew ſignes of the venomneſſe of the poyſon, he ran to embrace her, enſtrengthening himſelfe to receive that ſoule which by the right of Love he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed belonged to him. He was ſcarce come to her, when he ſaw, ſhe had loſt her ſenſes, become cold and immoveable as a ſtone, by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169974:86"/>the violence of the poiſon. No longer retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning patience to reſiſt the ſenſe of ſuch a loſſe, hee began to cry out in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if his ſoule remained onely in his Voice. Peradventure by thoſe Exclamations he perſwaded himſelfe he ſhould the eaſilies move the Fates to pitty: or rather requiring a preſent Remedy to the Malignity of the ill that could not permit of delay, it was imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he exalted his voice the looner to make the Gods know the Neceſſity of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Perceiving that Vowes, Prayers, and Lamentations, brought nothing but an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to his ſorrow, and that the laſt gaſpe of his life was afflicted by the Death of her, without whom he ſhould be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live, in ſome part to disburt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en his paſſion, he ſaid: Moſt unhappy <hi>Oleandro!</hi> who haſt undergone Death a thouſand times before thou couldſt die. <hi>Ariama,</hi> I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee; I follow thee <hi>Ariama.</hi> It is not juſt that thou ſhouldſt goe alone among the Ghoſts, without thy beloved <hi>Oleandro</hi> for thy gaide. I will take order that the ſword ſhall prevent the malignity of the Poiſon: but it is not fitting that thoſe Armes which were prepared for thy Defence ſhould offend me. But I ſhould not at leaſt deprive thy Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of my Teares. Thou wouldſt be too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, dying without being mourned for by him that loves thee.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:169974:87"/>
               <p>His Tongue could no longer obey his Heart, when the Drinke exerciſing its force, prevailed upon all his ſenſes. Yet with his Eyes he celebrated his laſt Duties to her, who found Death in nothing ſo painefull, as by ſeeing him neare to overtake her. Hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually held his eyes open, as if he would not permit that her Funerals ſhould be ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized without Lights. Laſtly, they both ſhewed Signes that they were arrived to that poynt, which by Nature is made common to all.</p>
               <p>This Spectacle had hardly given notice to the Damſells of this Tragedie, but they were heard to ſtrike the Aire with an infinitie of ſhreeks. With ſighes and Lamentations they contended to pay Tribut to the Death of their Lady. They knew not how to Honour ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Exequies, but with ſuddaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the heart. It ſeemed that with an affectionate Emulation they agreed by turnes to ſhowre forth Teares. Many fearing they might by others be exceeded in weeping, tore their Haires. Others, accuſing their hearts of an over-hardneſſe at ſo miſerable a chance, ſtruck their Breaſts, as if they meant to break them; peradventure, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Hands had more power then their Eyes. They had given no intermiſſion to theſe ſo pittifull, and ſo unprofitable duties to the Dead, if the preſence of ſome Knights,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169974:87"/>(who at theſe ſo ſorrowfull outcries ran in) had not interrupted their Lamentations. Theſe having received Information of what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne, drew neare to exerciſe that Piety to the Carkaſſes, that was not allowed them to practice with the living.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the beginning of the new yeare ſome ſtrange ſignes were ſeen in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which made them ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, if not feare, the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill. A blazing ſtar, which was diſcovered in heaven an houre before the Sun, aſtoniſhed the eyes, and the Judgements of all. The ſimpler ſort believed it a Prodigie that foretold the ruine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The Religious called it a tongue of the Gods, with which they advertiſed men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Crimes. The Souldiers ſaid it could foretell nothing but bloud and ſlaughter. The Courtiers which flatter the Genius of Princes even in things impoſſible, affirmed it declared the death of the Enemies to the Crowne. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and malignant figuring for truth what they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169974:88"/>deſired, believed it portended the deſtruction of the Prince, and mutation of the Empire.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> that knew it was unfit altogether to ſlight theſe Characters of heaven, looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it with ſome feare, although with his tongue he expreſſed contrary opinions of it He very well knew that the feare of remote dangers in a Prince ſerves as a fomentation to the wicked. He ſaid it was a condenſe vapour of the earth, upon which the Sun had employed the utmoſt of his force. That he gloried that with new lights the heaven applanded the felicity of his State: and that if it came to foretell any thing of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure he could not deny it, ſeeing <hi>Dianeas</hi> Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als grew neare. Thus he endeavoured to deceive the minds of others, whileſt his own heart preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the misfortunes which hung over his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The ſudden falling of his Statue without being touched increaſed his terrour. It remained nevertheleſs entire, though being placed on high, it was imagined it could not have falne without being broken into a thouſand pieces. There were many heads of dead people found in his Garden, it is not to be gueſſed whence they ſhould be brought. The Statue of the firſt King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was ſeene to ſweat and tremble, as if it meant to depart from the place where it ſtood.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> affrighted by theſe ſad Omens, although he feigned to diſſemble it, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant diligence notwithſtanding he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to procure all meanes of defence for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He ſurveyed all the Fortifications, added
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169974:89"/>new ſouldiers to encreaſe their ſtrength, received ſtrangers into pay, recalled all that were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed under the penalty of loſing a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution; and laſtly omitted not any diligence to avoid thoſe dangers which the Armes of his enemies threatned him with. All this verily was done with much eaſe, becauſe the publike Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury was growne infinitely rich by the peace of many yeares. And now to ſpend it was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more than neceſſary, ſince money cannot be laid forth more worthily than for the defence of the Country, and liberty.</p>
            <p>To the Duke of <hi>Cerine</hi> he committed his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces, a man of a known fidelity, and of no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary valour, of Cuſtomes ſo ſevere, and of ſo proud a behaviour, that he had rendred himſelfe odious to the Court. The King loved him, either becauſe he knew he was obliged to him by trialls of his experience, or through ſome unknown violence of his Genius. All the ill offices of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Salandra,</hi> who enjoyed a prime place in the affections of his Majeſty, were not ſufficient to retard him from that honour. The Land-Militia recerved command from the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> So the King would, although all the Councell ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome diſlike of it; not for his valour, which was above compariſon, but becauſe they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that loſt to their pretentions, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the merits of others. The wiſdome of his Majeſty who would not confide ſo much in thoſe ſubjects in whom he knew the defects of ambition, and inexperience fixed upon him,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169974:89"/>whoſe alliance he loved no leſſe than his vertue. He delayed the Nuptials he had deſigned for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anea</hi> untill ſuſpitions and jealouſies had rendred him maſter of himſelfe. He would not adde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to thoſe that hated him, and he would by his Daughter keep alive the affections of thoſe that loved him, out of hope only to attaine her in marriage.</p>
            <p>Ere he ſuffered him to depart to his Charge, after Commiſſions which contained an authority abſolute above all the Kingdome, he ſaid to him: Duke, we have committed the Kingdome of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> to the valour of your ſword, aſcertained to ſee in your virtue our defence, and your glory. To attempt to ſpeak any thing to inanimate, you were to do injurie to my election, and your merit. Know only that our intereſts are common, &amp; that yours ſhall be the Palmes of victory, and the ſpoiles of the enemy. The Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a moſt humble reverence, preparing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which was not conſented to by the King, whileſt others of the Councell comming in they fell into a Conſultation of War.</p>
            <p>All things neceſſary being provided the Duke went into the field; being unwilling that the City ſhould be troubled with Souldiers, or that they ſhould be effeminated by the eaſe of the City. He quartered his Army into all the Ports of the Iſland the moſt expoſed to invaſion, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only a great number of it to aide thoſe that ſhould be diſtreſſed, when an enemy ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to land. He uſed all diligence to ſecure
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169974:90"/>the weakeſt places, with ſo much follicitude, as if he were the moſt obliged to obey; when darkneſſe diſmiſſed the Pioneers and Souldiers from work, he (under the ſpecies of walking) obſerved all the Sentinels, and took notice of all advantages that might ſecure him from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes of his enemies. One Evening, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from his Tent, whileſt he was viewing the ſhore, he perceived himſelfe called upon by a voice not well diſtinguiſhed by him. Suddenly turning himſelfe, ſuſpecting a ſpectre, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at his feet (by the favour of the light of the moone, which peradventure more than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all was prodigall of her beames, as inquiſitive after thoſe wonders) the Princeſs of <hi>Nigrepont,</hi> whom he many times had bemoaned as dead.</p>
            <p>Are you (ſaid the Duke) the Princeſs of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grepont</hi> my Lady, or ſome aereal ſpirit that would deceive me under a counterfeit likeneſſe? I am neither a ſpirit, nor your Lady, replied <hi>Floridea,</hi> who although the unfortunate Princeſs of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grepont,</hi> and abandoned by all aſſiſtances of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, have been unwilling to dye without ſeeing you. The Duke without the leaſt delay ran with open Armes to embrace her: But ſhe putting him back, ſaid: <hi>Viralto</hi> (for ſo the Duke of <hi>File<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was called) I ought not to receive theſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities before I have aſſurance you are mine. You are the deſigned Husband for <hi>Dianea,</hi> and ſucceſſour to the Crowne of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as Fame gives forth. If this be true I will not oppoſe your deſires. I ſhould love you but a little, if for my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169974:90"/>ſimple ſatisfaction I ſhould attempt to retard your greatneſs. From you I beſeech no more but that I may not be deceived. If Deſtiny will not you ſhall be mine, I will accommodate my mind to ſerve you, as I have formerly applyed my heart to love you.</p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Cyprus,</hi> nor <hi>Dianea</hi> (replyed the Duke) have beauties, or greatneſſes that can alienate me from my ſelfe. I was borne yours, and ſo I chooſe to dye. I beſeech you (O Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) mortiſie not the content that I receive by ſeeing you reſtored to the world, and to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of all, ſince ever in my heart and thought I have preſerved you alive. A Lover ſhould not give credit to Fame, which is but an Eccho of the moſt vulgar untruths. There is no accident that can ſtir the conſtancy of that mind which can eaſier be broken than bowed.</p>
            <p>If this be true (replyed <hi>Floridea</hi>) let us fly this Heaven which nouriſheth ſo malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. I cannot beleeve you mine whileſt I ſee you ſo neare thoſe Objects which (though they cannot conquer your conſtancy) torment me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs with a jealouſie. To interpoſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay will but be to augment my diffidence, or to accuſe you of inconſtancy. <hi>Viralto</hi> added; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I ſhall be ready to ſerve you when I ſhall have command over my own will. King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> hath committed theſe Armies to my truſt. To abandon them without an occaſion would caſt upon me a note of infamy, and name of a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. You ſhall ever have ſoveraignty over all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169974:91"/>things that depend on me. For the preſent my word is given, and I have obliged my ſelfe. If the feare I had of infamy withheld me not, I ſhould have firſt preferred that ſupplication. Know therefore that I have no greater deſire, and that I would eagerlie endeavour (my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſafe) to breake all delaies. Concerning your feares, they ſhall be ſecured by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your own eyes, which ſhall be witneſſes of all my Actions. <hi>Floridea</hi> changed colour, and after a ſhort ſilence anſwered: You deceive me, and doubly deceive me, ſince you deny to do ſo. Love is a pretence that overcomes all things. Excuſes become Reaſons when they are attired under the mantle of Affection. But how can I imagine you mine when you confeſſe your ſelfe obliged to others? If that engagement be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, whoever hath bound you to it may as well oblige you not to love me. What can you anſwer me to this? But that Obligation is not valuable, becauſe affecting me, all your employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have dependency upon my will, ſo that it was not in your power to engage your ſelfe to the ſervice of another, being mine. But preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not wanting to juſtifie your departure; your Kingdome of <hi>Nigrepont</hi> (for ſo it ought to be called) groanes for your abſence; your own Intereſts ought to be preferred to thoſe of others. A Princeſſe diſinheritated implores your aide; this by the Obligation of Knighthood you ſhould not refuſe me. Beſides, what doth King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> loſe by your departure? The enemy is far off,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169974:91"/>and peradventure but imaginary. The Militia hath other Chiefetaines, and neare the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, who may every moment receive aſſiſtance from his Majeſty. Our danger contrary wiſe would be great: The King hath deſigned you the Husband to <hi>Dianea;</hi> if you refuſe behold the hatred of a Prince, which is alwaies mortall. Kings inſtitute Laws of their wills, and will what they will. He that attempts to oppoſe their deſires, may alſo endeavour to fixe the motion of the Heavens. Much more how will his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter endure you ſlighting her, whom ſhe affects more than her ſelfe? What hindrances ſoever you excuſe your ſelfe on, you very well know how to remove. An impoſſibility hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in the mind of Grandees which proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the execution of that which falls not under reaſon. You will be enforced to accept of her, and I to dye perceiving my ſelfe deceived. But I very well foreſee my miſery. That affection is weake which ſuffers it ſelfe to be overcome by ambition, and a conceit of what others may judge of it. That (in Princes) is united with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which meets with their ſatisfaction. He loves not that is too ſcrupulous. You care not for me, and perhaps upon my ruines you have raiſed your hopes. You are willing to abide in <hi>Cyprus</hi> to have occaſion to be compelled to betray me.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Floridea</hi> ended, giving way to her teares, which fell in ſuch abundance that a leſſer virtue than that of <hi>Viralto</hi> had ſuffered it ſelfe to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. He not withſtanding enforced himſelf
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169974:92"/>to perſwade her, ſaying; You make me (Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) ſuſpitious of your affection whileſt you ſeeme careleſs of my honour. And what will you find to love in me, when by all tongues you ſhall heare me reported infamous? Is it poſſible for you ſo to humble your mind as to looke upon me, endure me, and love me for a Traitour? If you do this to aſſure my loyalty, you have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, having received continually proofes of my fidelity. How can you ſatisfie your ſelfe that I ſhould affect you, if I know not how to love my Prince? You would have good occaſion to ſuſpect inconſtancy in my heart, ſeeing me trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to him who hath truſted me with a Kingdome? Who deceives his Prince that is able by force to puniſh his falſeneſs, may much more eaſily abuſe the innocency of a maid, who hath nothing but teares to repulſe her injuries. He that loves without reaſon makes no eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his honour: Contrariwiſe, he that hath placed his affections on a Princeſſe ought (above others) to be zealous of his Reputation, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon honour is more neceſſary in a Prince than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. What avails it me that King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> loſeth nothing, if I by my departure endanger my all? Whoever pretends that love ſerves as a ſhield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all things, hath perhaps an intention to counterfeit himſelfe enamoured only to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unworthy things. Excuſe me (Princeſſe) whileſt my Reputation is treated of, I ought not love you, nor obey you, you ſhall perceive in the reſidue of all my undertakings, that neither the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169974:92"/>authority of the King, nor all the force of the world ſhall have power to oblige me to any other affection but yours. When I am free from his Majeſtles employments I will be yours. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your experimented gentleneſſe of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in loving me for this once in excuſing me.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons did not at all appeaſe the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Floridea,</hi> who rather caſting her ſelfe at the Dukes feet aggravated the perpetuity of her miſeries, making uſe of all thoſe Arts affection could adminiſter. She ſaid: Obſtinate Fortune, that doſt impoveriſh me in conqueſts, and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt the felicities with ſo much bitterneſſe, that thou daily compelleſt me to deſire to be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. To ſee you and behold you ſo neare me was my higheſt deſire, now that poſseſſion and ſight becomes my greater torment. Cruell One, is it poſſible, is it poſſible that theſe praiers ſhould not perſwade you, theſe ſighs move you, that theſe tears ſhould not mollifie you? Unfortunate <hi>Florsdea!</hi> unable to prevaile; no, not with weeping! She ſaid more, but was conſtrained to ſilence the Dukes Guard approaching, who brought him Orders from his Majeſty to draw up to the Port of <hi>Cethina</hi> with the Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Dorcene</hi> King of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> who as a Friend came to King <hi>Vaſſileo.</hi> He was aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at this newes, knowing the perfidiouſneſs of that Nation; wherefore making the Princeſs to retire into a ſecure place, who forbore not her teares and lamentations, he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169974:93"/>to the ordering of the Militia to make a pompous ſhew of the Forces of the Kingdom, and to be ready for defence if the <hi>Thracians</hi> ſhould attempt any novelty.</p>
            <p>This while <hi>Diaſpe</hi> repoſing between the Armes of <hi>Dianea,</hi> in a ſhort time recovered his health. There is not a more profitable medicine for Lovers, than the preſence of the beloved Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. He reſolved to depart thence with <hi>Prodir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who was alſo cured; <hi>Dianea</hi> being called thence by her Father againſt the arrivall of the <hi>Thracian.</hi> One morning betimes, ere the Sun could looke upon their Action, they iſſued out of the Grott, with an intention to come to the Court at the ſame time as the King of <hi>Thrace. Diaſpe</hi> could not think of his Arrival without the oppreſſion of his heart. His memory repreſented to him thoſe unhappy objects which had formerly reduced him neare to deſperation. He knew the <hi>Thracians</hi> impious in their actions and name; and King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> too eaſie to beleeve all things. To divert himſelfe from theſe thoughts, he beſeeched the Duke to diſcloſe to him his birth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſome part of his adventures to him; what fortune had brought him into that Kingdome, and what accident had guided him into thoſe Receſses, which he imagined concealed from the eyes of heaven it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>I have (replied <hi>Prodirto</hi>) ſo obſcure a name, and am of ſo meane a birth, that it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne you to know, and I bluſh to relate. My Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius enclining to Armes, made me inquiſitive
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169974:93"/>after the greateſt Wars in the World, I have been one in them with little benefit to my ſelfe, although with much danger. All Victories were referred to the Commanders in chiefe, and the valour of a poore Souldier, that hazards his life a thouſand times, can hardly arrive to ſuch a ſtipend as will ſerve to maintaine life with. I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to merit the favour of the chiefe, with expoſing my ſelfe to all dangers, but it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not. Grown void of hope I have many times been ready to deſpaire. If Valour hath not the protection of favour or Gold, it wants the marke of deſert. Promiſed rewards ſerve to no other end but to promote Envy. My moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing yeares being ſpent, deſpairing to attaine an higher preferment, I aſsayed with a friend of mine to ſteale away the Princeſs of <hi>Colchos.</hi> The Enterprize ſucceeded fortunately. Figuring (with this Prize) great Conqueſts in my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I imbarqued for the <hi>Baleares</hi> Iſlands, where I promiſed my ſelfe a ſecure Retreat. My ill Fortune, that accompanied me in the ſame Veſsell, made me caſt aſhore by a tempeſt at ſea in this Iſland, where the Princeſs was ſtolne from me by my friend, with whom I had truſted her. Whileſt with curioſity I ſought after their flight, I ſaw her hid among theſe Rockes, where you firſt challenged me to the combate. The Fall I then had caſt me into ſo great a ſwoon, that (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to my ſelfe) if my bloud had not aſsured me of it, I ſhould have thought my ſelfe deceived by adreame. I found my ſelfe in ſo ill a condition
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169974:94"/>(thankes to your Valour) that if I had not been ſuccoured by the Piety of ſome Marriners, I had been without any hope of my life. As ſoone as my wounds allowed me any motion, I fixed my mind upon finding the Princeſs, without whom my poverty gave me not leiſure to live in quiet. I came to the foot of the Mountaine, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Entrance, <hi>I</hi> preſently conceited that there my traiterous Friend concealed his Theft. I was ſcarce entred into the Court, but you preſſing on me, that befell me which you know. This in ſubſtance is the whole of my life. I beſeech your generouſneſſe, that hath ſo much reſpected the recovery of my health, to diſcover to me to whoſe hands I am obliged for my life.

               <head>The Hiſtory of <hi>Diaſpe</hi> and his Brother.</head>
               <p>I (replyed <hi>Diaſpe</hi>) am Prince of <hi>Creet,</hi> though in this Kingdome not known but for a Knight belonging to King <hi>Vaſſileo.</hi> Three yeares ſince I returned from Forreigne Wars to the Court to comfort the age of my Father, who bemoaned my abſence. Thither three <hi>Paleſtine</hi> Merchants chanced to come with three Pictures of the moſt beautifull Princeſſes of this Age. They were the Princeſs of <hi>Nigrepont,</hi> her of <hi>Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ia,</hi> &amp; ſhe of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus.</hi> Come to Court, they preſented them (in gift) to my mother, who cauſed them to be expoſed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169974:94"/>to the ſight of all. They were loaden with the commendations of the beholders, and the envy of all the women. Particularly <hi>Dianea</hi> could not be beheld but with a prejudice to the Faireſt. All hearts at that ſight rebelled from the Vaſſalage to any other beauty. It provoked flames even in the moſt cold breaſts, in whom Age had conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med heat.</p>
               <p>My Brother and I at the firſt ſight gave up our Soules to her. We ſtood unremoved, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating it with that anxiety as Northern Nations gaze upon the Sun after a moſt long night. We continued divers daies to ſacrifice to it our eyes, and ſighs; as if that Picture had been the Idoll of our Pleaſures. We remained alwaies fixed looking upon it; but when we were interrupted by others, who came to feed their eyes upon thoſe marvelous Beauties, which though but counterfeit had the power to torment minds. I regan to look upon my brother with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, not being able to endure Rivalls in a Picture. He who had a Genius not to be ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to feare, finding an opportunity took down the Picture of <hi>Dianea</hi> to carry it to his Lodgings. I came accidentally juſt upon the time as he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to one of his. I grew ſuddenly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and (inflamed by Love) injured him in ſo high a manner that he was enforced to lay hand on his ſword. I that perceived ſo much boldneſs in a younger brother, my anger preventing all diſcourſe, try'd my utmoſt force to have ſlaine him. He defended himſelfe with ſo great
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169974:95"/>courage, that I was ſometimes in danger to be killed.</p>
               <p>The noiſe and confuſion carried the voices to the King and Queene, who both running forth at this uproare, made us caſt away our Armes, and embrace, although neither of us laid aſide his anger. The occaſion of this contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood, the King reprehended me with ſo ſevere a faſhion, that I had not the confidence to looke him on the face. <hi>Dianea's</hi> Picture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in my mothers hands, who profeſſed ſhe would never part with it to any body.</p>
               <p>I paſſed away ſome daies with ſo much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency, that I thought my ſelfe unable to live them. I ſhould have flowne to have ſeen the Originall of that Picture which afflicted my memory, if the feare of my Father, the ſeaſon contrarie, and the enmity between the Crowns had not been interpoſed to my deſires. The ſame anxietie tortured the heart of my brother, who as the younger could much leſs withſtand amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſſaults which worke with the greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence where they find more heat. I avoided the occaſion of meeting him, becauſe my eyes could not endure him. Brethrens enmities are ever mortall. He, fomented by the Adulation of thoſe that ſerved him, flung forth ſome words of ſlighting, which agmented my diſdaine. My Fathers Age, which enclined to the Grave, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs permitted me not that I ſhould preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate my hopes. And although I percived my mother ready to provoke him, either for ſeeing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169974:95"/>me diſobedient, or that it is a property of that Sex to love the worſe, I cared not for it. Finally, women are women; as prone to hatreds as they are to Love.</p>
               <p>My brothers ſervants were fruſtrated of hopes, looking on me as Succeſſour to the Crowne. There is none that dares thunder againſt heaven which can retort thunder. They certified me from time to time of all his actions, whereupon he could hardly find ſecreſie in his own thoughts. By theſe I was one morning advertized that he with <hi>Dianea's</hi> Picture was departed from <hi>Creete.</hi> I followed him with an evill intent, conceiting that my mother had given it him, or that he had ſtolne it. Two miles out of the City I overtooke him. He having eyes impatient of not behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Object which felicitated his heart, made a Favourite of his to carry the Picture. I preſently accuſed him of ſawcineſs, whileſt in deſpite of one whom he ſhould reverence as Heire to the Kingdome he bore from him that Jewell. I added other words of ſlighting him and diſdaine; calling him many times unworthy to fixe a look on that Picture, which ought not to be viewed by a raſh man, by one diſobedient to his Father, his Prince, and his Brother.</p>
               <p>I ſtay'd for no anſwer, but ſtretched forth my hand to lay hold on the Picture. He who carried it, who was the Count of <hi>Sfour,</hi> intending by that act to merit ſuperlativelie the affection of my Brother, would not let me take it. I drew my ſword, and with two blows made him ſee that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169974:96"/>I knew how to make my ſelfe obeyed more by my hands than my tongue. My brother, who ſaw the Count wounded, and the Picture loſt, ſaid to me: Prince, If you would that I ſhould reverence you, tyrannize not ſo over me. To offend him ſo without cauſe who ſerves me, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of that which I juſtly poſſeſſed, are things that would take away patience even from Marbles. He that aimes to deprive me of that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture muſt firſt take my life. Having ſpoke this, he drew his ſword and ſtrooke at me, whileſt I did the ſame. Our blowes were ſo thick, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo much anger, that thoſe that followed us had not the courage to interpoſe themſelves. At laſt, perceiving us both woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that my intention was that my brothers life ſhould ſatisfie for the bloud I ſhed, they drew their Swords, and threw themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, with danger to ſome of them, who were recompenced with ſome wounds.</p>
               <p>My brother being retired, whileſt I would not be pacified, I ſaw him fall down in a ſwoone, I know not whether for the paine of his wounds, or the loſs of the Picture. I ſuppoſing him dead had not the heart to undergoe the juſtice of my Father, ſevere to all, but inexorable againſt thoſe of his houſe; I withdrew my ſelfe into a Caſtle nigh to the Sea, where, being cured of my hurts, I ſpent all my houres in Contemplation of that Object, which I uſed to call the Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of my Felicities. All my ends, all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, all my hopes determined in thoſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169974:96"/>lines, and thoſe colours. One day by craft being tempted forth of the Caſtle, the Picture was ſtolne from my eyes, not heart. Not being able to appeaſe my mind for griefe at ſuch a loſs, I unknown imbarqued me for <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The time of the yeare was contrary, but gaining the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of one with a good ſum of Gold, I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſelfe a ſecure voyage, confident in the goodneſs of the Veſſell.</p>
               <p>I landed in <hi>Cyprus:</hi> And would have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company but that of my thoughts. After much Travell I ſtaied at a Fountaine, which they call the amorous Fountaine: And there being ſurprized by night, I took up my reſt. My thoughts had ſcarce given place to ſleep, but I was ſeized upon by divers phantaſmes. Me thought I ſaw <hi>Dianea</hi> aſſaulted by two moſt fierce Dragons, and that the one ſtrove with the other which ſhould drinke her bloud. I heard her reprove me of cowardize in this danger, that I did not aide her, whom I affected more than my ſelfe. She her ſelfe implored with redoubled entreaties my aſſiſtance. She ſaid: Prince of <hi>Creete,</hi> why are you come to viſit me if you will not ſuccour me? Doth not then my preſence merit the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your ſword? Have you paſſed the ſea only to ſee me dye? A ſhadow of my beauties have had the power to bow your heart, and ſhall not <hi>Dianea</hi> her ſelfe perſwade you to defend her? Friend, I am yours, afford me your help. The Gods have made you arrive in this Kingdome for my defence, it being but reaſon that you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169974:97"/>ſhould come to guard her who expects it from you, At this I awakened, oppreſſed with ſo much ſorrow, that I know not whether the veritie of the ſucceſs could have been able to have tormented me more.</p>
               <p>I afterwards fell aſleep againe for awhile, but being againe awakened by the ſame Illuſions, I began to complaine of my Fortune, which diſquieted me even in the Repoſes of Night. I imagined my ſelfe the worſt of all Creatures; for Beaſts at leaſt by night have a Truce from the Miſeries of day. Amidſt theſe thoughts I heard ſome voices, which arrived at my eares, no otherwiſe then a Whiſper. I approached nearer, and heard the name of <hi>Dianea</hi> redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, being unable to underſtand the <hi>reſt,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to chaſtiſe thoſe that durſt profane that name. A curioſity to underſtand the end, ſtai'd my hand. I preſently then heard that <hi>Dianea</hi> was to come ſuddainly to the Fountaine; for ſo it was appointed: with other words which gave me not leave to conceive the End, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had not underſtood the beginning.</p>
               <p>I felt the greateſt alteration in the world, in hearing that within a while I ſhould ſee her, who had made me abandon our Kingdome, and Countrey. I received it as a moſt auſpicious Omen, that ſhe whom I adored ſhould come to meet me at my arrivall in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> I counted the Moments, and many times blamed the Sunne, that not haſtning his courſe, retarded my joyes.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:169974:97"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurora</hi> now was come forth, and the Birds deafned the Aire with their Songs, when <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> made a Scene of her beauties to my eyes. I pardoned the ſlowneſſe of the Sunnes Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, for it was reaſon he ſhould give place to her. I blamed the boldneſſe of Art that durſt endeavour with pencils to emulate ſo faire a Worke, that ſurpaſſed all Ideas. The Image of the Picture was like the true, as a ſhadow the Light. I had time to behold her at my pleaſure. And it was perchance to bleſſe my eyes which could never be wearied with looking on her. Two Moores followed her, I know not whether to make more ſhine forth the ſplendour of her Beauty, or that they had aſſumed that Colour to approach the nearer to her eyes. As ſoon as ſhe came, ſhe put her hands into thoſe waters, which ran with a ſtrife to kiſſe them. And it ſeemed, that growne Ambitious they ſwell'd more then uſuall to touch her face, as if they deſired to be changed into that lively colour, which impurpled the Cheeks of <hi>Dianea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this while foure <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> appear, which ran ſuddenly to <hi>Dianea;</hi> I that was unable to ſee her injured, whom I accounted part of my ſelf, came againſt them with ſo much Courage, that with two blowes three loſt their lives. At the preſence of an Object which I eſteemed Divine, I could not but ſhew a valour miraculous. The fourth attempted his ſafety by flight, but in vaine, for I quickly overtaking him, immediately killed him, although <hi>Dianea</hi> cryed out, that I ſhould let him
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169974:98"/>live; She would know the originall of theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had plotted them, who had any hand in them, that they might receive puniſhment accordingly: Of all which hitherto ſhe had not received the leaſt knowledge. I would needs kiſſe her hand, beſeeching her to pardon me, if the deſire to ſee her avenged had not allowed me to grant life to that Murtherer; for which there was much reaſon, for I being come to do Sacrifice to her Beauties, I could not but at the leaſt offer up the lives of thoſe ſo unmannerly people; ſhe thanked me with a Garb ſo repleat with gentleneſſe, that every word ſeemed a Dart which transfixed my ſoule.</p>
               <p>She ſolicitouſly enquired my name, in which I did not ſatisfie her, adding; That I was not to be knowne, untill I had ſome merit to render me worthy to be knowne. That I had paſs'd the Sea to no other end, but to ſerve her, enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Fame, which I had found infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to truth. With ſuch Diſcourſes I wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on her to the Pallace, which is even that which ſtands adjoyning to the Cave. There I received moſt ſignall Honours; and this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe being publiſhed in the Court, King <hi>Vaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo</hi> uſed me with a demonſtration of ſo much affection, that I envyed not the higheſt.</p>
               <p>He would have added, how being tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the favours of the Princeſs, he aſſumed the confidence to reveale his affection, and how meeting there with a correſpondency, he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attaine her for his wife; But he broke off
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169974:98"/>his Relation, being interrupted with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the Souldierie that attended the King of the <hi>Thracians.</hi> He was met in a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did pompe by the Duke of <hi>Filena.</hi> The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were placed in a decent poſture, Squadrons of Horſe and Foot ſo interwoven in ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an order, that the <hi>Thracian</hi> could not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf in beholding them. He was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied but only by an hundred of his <hi>Thracian</hi> youth of the nobleſt birth. Their Apparrel was wondrous rich. The Chaines and Jewels they wore exceeded Eſtimation. Yet the ſtrangeneſs of their Habit was more admirable then the coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of it.</p>
               <p>He upon a Courſer all covered with Velvet, made an excellent ſhew of his dexterity. Hee took pleaſure to make that Horſe curvet, as if he were alſo ambitious to make himſelfe obeyed even by Beaſts. Hee ſubmitted to the Bridle with ſo much readineſſe, that it well appeared his Genius inſtructed him, that he was not to be handled by Grandees, but with his Obedience. Though Horſes know not Adulation, this ſeemed that with his motion, and neighings, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no other but to flatter him. The <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> had the Duke of <hi>Eilena</hi> on his left hand, with whom he diſcourſed of Military Armies. Each other of his Court was attended on by a great Field-Officer. And in this ſtate they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <hi>Arſinoe.</hi> At the Gates he was waited for by all the Councell; And come to the Pallace, King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> met him without the Gates of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169974:99"/>the great Hall. The Welcomes and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were redoubled on both ſides, with ſo high an expreſſion of affection, as if nature had obliged them to love one another. They both ſate them downe under a cloth of State, which covered two moſt rich Chaires. <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> took the right hand, though he feigned himſelfe willing to have reſigned it to <hi>Dorcone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here thoſe keeping ſilence, that were come to be preſent at this firſt Audience, The <hi>Thracian</hi> in his own Language ſaid: That he was come in perſon to confirme that peace which had ever been preſerved inviolate by his Predeceſſors: That Accidents never had the power to alter that diſpoſition which had alwaies rendred his heart obliged to love King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> as a Father. That the Reports that he had raiſed men againſt the Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> had extreamly afflicted him; ſo that his Affection could not ſuffer him, that the ſecurity of that Kingdome ſhould grow jealous at his preparations for warre: That he had built a Fleet to make ſhew of his power, not to uſurpe upon the States of others, or diſturbe his friends. He ſpoke long upon this matter, and with ſo much eagerneſſe, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceive whether thoſe Words were the Daughters of Truth, or of Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> anſwered, that he aſcribed to his greateſt Fortune, in ſeeing himſelf honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the viſit of ſuch a King, that it grieved him he was not young, that he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169974:99"/>him: but yet that this was an Adjunct of Glorie to the <hi>Thracian,</hi> that he would yield to one who was inferiour to him in merit, and that he would oblige without a hope of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency. That he thanked him for the trouble hee had took, and the peace confirm'd, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not greater deſire in his ſo declining yeares then to enjoy quietneſſe. He plied him with ſo many expreſſions of Affection, that he enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Thracian</hi> to an humiliation.</p>
               <p>Riſing, they were led to the Princeſſe Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who hearing of it, came to receive them. The <hi>Thracian</hi> ſtood ſtill, fixing his eyes upon the Face of <hi>Dianea,</hi> with ſuch an Alteration, that it was eaſily obſerved by all. <hi>Dorcone</hi> firſt bowing to her, ſaid; Fair Princeſs, it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter felicity to be borne ſlaves in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to enjoy the ſight of ſuch a Beautie, then a King in <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi> I that have brought peace to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, cannot vouchſafe it to my heart, which will ever be aſſaulted by ſo divine Rarities. I beſeech you diſdaine not that I ſhould love you; that I might expreſſe my ambition to ſerve a Princeſs, who to enrich the world it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie ſhe ſhould receive Trophies from all the Beauties of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea,</hi> that with a diſcontented mind heard of the Arrivall of the <hi>Thracian,</hi> not onely for being raviſhed from the Embracements of <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> but alſo for the hatred ſhe bore that Nation, could not but with a diſdaine afford her eare to theſe words: Nevertheleſſe, with that diſſimulation
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169974:100"/>which is borne in the mouthes of great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, She anſwered: She beſought him to moderate thoſe commendations, that he might not put himſelfe into a danger to undertake the Defence of an unjuſt Thing, that in her there was no deſers that might move the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a King, in whom Nature and Fortune were met to render him ſuperiour to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</p>
               <p>Amidſt ſuch Complements <hi>Dorcone</hi> parted from <hi>Dianea,</hi> leaving nevertheleſſe his ſoule in pawne for the uſurie of the Delight of his eyes.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> would wait on him downe ſtaires, although the <hi>Thracian</hi> by all meanes poſſible refuſed it. They were on the laſt ſteps ready to part, when they were both ſtai'd by a noiſe of Armes, which made them both ſuſpicious of Treaſon. <hi>Dorcone</hi> ſaying to King <hi>Vaſſileo:</hi> Friend, are we ſecure of our Lives? King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> made no reply; but with a great deale of danger to his owne perſon, hee quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Tumult, and paſſing through the croud, went where it received originall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> who had met the <hi>Thracian,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow, accompanying him to the Court. In this while <hi>Celardo</hi> incited by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the comming of ſo great a Prince, was alſo arrived there to ſee thoſe meetings, which ſeldome happen, and alſo to ſatisfie the curioſity of a Knight, who ſome dayes before was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Gueſt. He was preſently taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> who remembring his ancient
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169974:100"/>Contempts, and imagining him come into that place, (in a Rivalſhip) for the love he bore <hi>Dianea;</hi> unable to containe himſelfe, he ſaid: Raſh man! Haſt thou yet the Confidence to approach him whom thou haſt ſo often offended? If the Majeſtie of King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> deſerved not all Reverence, you ſhould ſoone finde, I know well how to chaſtiſe the fond folly of thoſe that depart from their Duty. <hi>Celardo</hi> not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to receive Injuries, anſwered him, with advancing his hand to ſtrike him on the face, without delay unſheathing his ſword. <hi>Diaſpe</hi> avoiding the box on the Eare, drew likewiſe his forth. They that were neare them, were not ſlow to take Armes, crying out they ſhould ceaſe that Tumult. The Souldiers that were far off, ſuppoſing themſelves betray'd by the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> began to deale blowes with ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, that though King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> was a great way off, it was an inconvenience of conſequence for him to goe thither.</p>
               <p>His Majeſtie all this while holding <hi>Dorcone</hi> by the hand, made every one draw backe, and received a diſtinct Relation of the occaſion of this buſineſſe. Underſtanding <hi>Diaſpe</hi> was the Author, he drew neare to him, and with a countenance enflamed with anger, ſaid: <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> That honour that was done you in my Pallace, merited not that I ſhould receive ſo ill a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. If I bore not in my minde how much you have done for the Crowne, your head ſhould pay for the diſpleaſure you have done me. But
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169974:101"/>now content your ſelfe to depart hence without delay, that I may not have occaſion to puniſh your diſobedience, having in an high manner pardoned your Raſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diaſpe</hi> replied not, for King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> turning to <hi>Dorcone,</hi> who was going away, afforded him not leiſure to anſwer. He retired to his Lodgings, which was a Pallace ſutable to his birth and the liberality of the King whom he ſerved. Many of the Barons, and the principall of the Court came to condole with him his ill fortune, who having performed ſo many ſervices to the King, his Daughter, and Kingdome, received the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Baniſhment for his paines. But that yet he ought ſomething to diſpenſe with the Kings Anger, who knew not otherwiſe how to ſecure the diffidences of the <hi>Thracian,</hi> but with a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that exceeded his nature. That theſe firſt motions-being over, he would without doubt be reſtored to his former reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diaſpe</hi> anſwered, he had formerly learnt the Cuſtomes of Courts and Princes: That he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained not of King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> who followed but the example of others, that they recompenced great benefits with as great ingratitudes, and that therefore one day he hoped he ſhould reprove him of a reſolution ſo precipitate. That he would be no more ſeene in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but greater, or an equall to King <hi>Vaſſileo.</hi> Afterwards, being licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them, he wrote to the King, and Dutcheſs of <hi>Belprato.</hi> Leaving theſe Letters with full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, with two Squires only he departed to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169974:101"/>embarque himſelfe. Finding a Veſſell in the Harbour he went aboord, promiſing great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Rowers if within a few daies they arrived at <hi>Creet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt the Veſſell driven forward by the Waves, &amp; the Rowers flew upon the ſea, he fix'd in the conſtancy of his thoughts, knew not what to do but bemoane his miſery. He repented his departure without leave from his Lady the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, having left her in a time of ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without attending for her Commands; whereon he thus reaſoned with himſelfe.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible that this heart ſhould be moved with any affections but thoſe of love? Can then the Command of King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile more than my Dutie to my Obligations? Shall Feare then win upon this mind which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet knew what it was?

                     <p>IT grieves me that the ingratitudes I have foundin your Kingdome compell me to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them unwillingly: One who had ſaved your life deſerved not an infamous Exile for uſing his ſword in his own defence. I ſhall not live if I do not guard my ſelfe, nor muſt I do ſo without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you. But paſt things admit not of adviſe: Neither pretend I to excuſe my ſelfe. Yet aſſure your ſelfe, that I am one that with my Armes will repay the injuries of my Superiours, and I caſt away my counterfeit name of <hi>Diaſpe,</hi> that I may have no remembrance that I have ſerved you.</p>

               <p>Theſe Letters in the Councell of State occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a great Commotion, whereupon Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were made choice of, that they might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi>'s Reaſons into <hi>Creete.</hi> That he was not engaged to know thoſe that would not be known. That the Majeſty of a King ought to be reverenced by all, and much rather in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of another King. The danger into which all were run in that Tumult, that they ſcarce took notice of, or ſpared the life of their naturall Prince.

                  <hi>CElardo</hi> anſwered, I know not who <hi>Diaſpe</hi> is. I know only that the Knight you ſpoke of, is my brother by bloud, though my Enemy by his Actions. We are both of us Sons to the King of <hi>Creete,</hi> though he for being the eldeſt hath attained the name of Prince, and next ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crowne. But of this I care not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of Fortune, becauſe ſhe workes blindly, and knows not how to favour deſert. Becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming both enamoured of the Picture of <hi>Dianea</hi> we fell to blowes; Anger eaſily reigning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene brothers unequall. To withdraw me from his fury, and not to adde afflictions to the declining age of my Father, I reſolved for ſome time on a departure from <hi>Creete.</hi> My Mother, that had not patience to looke on my departure, accompanied me with ſo many teares, that from them I took an unhappy preſage. She beſtowed upon me the Picture of <hi>Dianea</hi> which ſhe had kept by her by my Fathers command. My brother being certified of this by thoſe who by betraying me hoped to merit his favour, and purſuing me with many Attendants, by force bereaved me of the Picture, and had done ſo of my life alſo, if I, not baſely defending my ſelfe, had not given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to many to interpoſe themſelves to their own danger.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:169974:103"/>
               <p>My Brother, although wounded, would not returne to the Court, but retired himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known into a houſe neare the ſea in the Confines of the Kingdome, fearing (by as much as I can imagine) the diſpleaſure of my Father. I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſame, but with a deſigne not to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Picture, which although impreſſed on my heart, I deſired to have before my eies. All paſſions that proceed from humane affections are ſupportable, except thoſe of Love. I tried all meanes to recover the Picture, but all my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was in vaine, for he kept it alwaies by him, nor did he truſt it to any but himſelfe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that force was not the way to get it from him, I applied my mind to deceit, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without blame when it is uſed to overcome, and when violence is needleſſe. I appointed a day when he, (his being abſent) as he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, remained alone to vent forth with ſighs and lamentations the paſſions of his ſoule without the untruſty teſtimonie of any Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
               <p>I made a young maid appeare at his feet, who tearing her haire, and beating her breaſt, would have awakened the ſenſe of pitty in cruelty it ſelf. After ſhe had with her counterfeit tears won credit for her Tale, which <hi>Cretan</hi> women are very prone to; ſhe ſaid to him, That being walked with her ſiſter to the ſhore to take the aire, they were followed by one who pretended himſelfe a ſervant to my ſiſter; will not this wicked man, ſaid the Girle, make uſe of violence, ſince he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169974:104"/>may find our voices cannot awaken pity in the ſeas. And that the drineſſe of theſe ſands are not capable to commiſerate our teares. He preſentlie gave us notice of his ill meaning, making uſe of force to deprive her of her honour. She percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that her ſchreekes were loſt, and although the winds, moved to pittie, carried them far off, and that the ſea replied unto them, there being none that could heare them, betook her ſelfe to the ordinarie weapons of women, which are teeth and nailes. She will certainlie be overcome in this unequal contention, without ſuccour from your valour and goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Prince attended not that ſhe ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but laying hold on his ſword, ſaid, That ſhe ſhould teach him the way that he might give puniſhment to that unmannerlie man. She feigning ſhe was unable to ſtir afoot, ſhewed him whereabouts he ſhould find her ſiſter. The Prince leaving her ran haſtilie to the ſhore. The Maid in the meane while tooke the Picture of <hi>Dianea,</hi> of which there was no doubt but that it would have been known even by thoſe that have not ſeen the Sun. I having received it, without delay imbarqued with an intention for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to ſee if the pencill had flattered or copied thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I withall was not without hope of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Dianea</hi> for wife. In <hi>Creete</hi> there was no hope for my life, much leſſe for the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Whileſt tranſported with theſe thoughts I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me a Fortune faſtned to my deſires, ſhe that uſed to laugh at the vanity of my deſignes
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169974:104"/>made me ſee with how little wiſdome he works that raiſes hopes upon the inſtability of humane accidents. The ſea grew ſo diſturbed, that I had neither eies nor heart that could ſlight that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; The remembrance of it yet is horrible. It ſeemed all the Elements had conſpired our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. Heaven refuſed us the light of it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the ſight of it. The aire aſſaulted with winds deafned the ears of the Marriners, ſo that they could not obey the directions of the Pilots. The Seas foaming whirlepooles of waves from time to time threatned to ſwallow us. The Land made us afraid in the waters, we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting no other but ſome Rock to ſplit us. The Cock-boat, which is uſually the ſacred Anchor of thoſe that are ſhipwracked, was forced from us by the winds, after our Sailes were rent, our Maſts broke, and tacklings all torne.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe miſeries, I preferred my vows and prayers to that Image, which if it had had ſenſe would have been moved to laughter at my follies: I was ſo bold as to reprehend the winds, and blame the waves, as if they had had ſome knowledge of that beauty; or, as if the Picture of <hi>Dianea</hi> had been one of <hi>Jove.</hi> When I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the water (our Veſſell being ſhatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in many places) flowed in to drown us, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of <hi>Dianeas</hi> Picture, by the aſſiſtance of which I promiſed my ſelfe ſafety, with a plank I threw my ſelfe into the ſea, ſuffering my ſelfe to be carried by chance, while the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night permitted me not to diſcerne
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169974:105"/>Rocks, or the ſhore. I broke the waves for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an houre, keeping my ſelfe aloft with my hands and feet to breake them: But the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt not ceaſing, weary of my paines and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, I altogether abandoned my ſelfe; And I believe I loſt my ſenſes, although my hands, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by nature, never forſook their hold of the Planke.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell how long I continued in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor who tooke me out of the water, but that opening my eyes, although languiſhing, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining I had paſt into the other Life for a certain, an old man preſented himſelfe before me, whom I ſuppoſing to be <hi>Charon</hi> by the Deſcriptions I had heard from Poets; I ſaid to him, Pardon me (good old man) that I have not brought along with me your reward, for the ſea hath devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that I had. But leſt you ſhould refuſe to ferry me over to the other ſhore without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have a Picture with me, for which you may receive any money, if that beauty be valued in the <hi>Abyſſes;</hi> I know it will provoke envy in <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> and peradventure incite <hi>Pluto</hi> to ſteale her from above to felicitate theſe ſhades.</p>
               <p>The old man laughed at theſe words, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching me his hand, aſſured me I was alive, and that the Gods had taken pity of my youth. He brought me into a Cabbin more commodious than rich: And there omitted nothing that might do me good. Having made me go to bed to dry my ſelf, and that thoſe moiſt and malignant vapours which I got in the water might be forced out of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169974:105"/>me; he ſaid: Sonne, here I live ſecure from the Tempeſts of the Sea, and the Lightnings of Heaven, I live to my owne ſatisfaction in a quietude and happineſſe; Ambition and Envy not entring under the Humilities of this roofe. The Bow and Angling-rod from day to day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me food; and perhaps the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the world, amidſt their Feaſts and Purples, enjoy not neare ſo much of felicity. Theſe Books are my companions, which beſide the Delight they afford, enrich the minde with moſt worthy Knowledges. This ſaid, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me with ſome precious Wines, adding; And theſe are alſo brought me by the Sea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my diligence: Being recovered, he left me to my reſt, going forth to provide ſomething for Supper.</p>
               <p>My ſleep was but for a moment; for being perpetually interrupted by Dreames, I could take no Repoſe in my bed. I aroſe and diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dianea's</hi> Picture, and found the water had done it no harme. I conceived the Sea had done reverence to it, believing it one of <hi>Venus:</hi> As if (I know not how) every extraordinarie beauty ſhould receive an augmentation from the Waters. I began a Diſcourſe to it with ſo eager an earneſtneſſe, as if it had had not onely a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to liſten to me, but alſo to afford me an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. My implorations were attended on by an infinitie of ſighes and teares, ever upbraiding my ſelfe with my owne unhappineſſe. I had ſeaſon enough to account my ſelfe miſerable,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169974:106"/>ſupplicating mercy from a Picture. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by the old man, before I could ſound a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to my thoughts, my minde was ſo diverted from all other things. He ſnatched the Picture from me, with ſuch a fury as if he meant to have torne it: And I think he would have done ſo, if my Entreaties had not over-ruled him. I beſeeched him to pardon that which had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned uninjured by the Furie of the Sea: That if he meant to deſtroy it, leſt he ſhould become enamoured of it, thoſe eyes ought to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed which were preſumptuous to behold it: Not the Picture which was immoveable, and being inſenſible, tempted no body to love. He taking more diſguſt at theſe words, anſwered me:</p>
               <p>Sonne! Is it poſſible that Senſe ſo tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes over your reaſon! Is it poſſible, that a piece of Art, ſo much the more vile, by how much the more common, ſhould torment the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of an heart that is greater then Art or Nature. I blame not the Picture, which is a Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, derived to us from the Gods, which hath power to eternize thoſe which would not live elſe but by the Memorie of our eyes. I finde fault with the intemperance of our pleaſures, the madneſſe of our thoughts, the blindneſſe of our underſtanding, which receives an alteration from imaginary Phantaſmes, feigned Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Likeneſſes, imitated or flatter'd. What would you ſay, if this Picture ſhould not be a Copy of Life, but the conceited invention of a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169974:106"/>Pencill, which without looker on, had imitated the Ideas of Beauty? Is it handſome then for a man to languiſh for the Extravagancies of a hand, which more frequently imitates fancy then ſenſe? Is it fit then to ſubmit the ſoveraignty of our mindes to a thing inſenſible, which too often we deny to the Powers of heaven it ſelf? Sonne, to be in love, is a continuall unhappineſs, becauſe Love covets, ſubjects, and renders vile; And becauſe it compares a man to a Carkaſle lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſoule, which flies to eſtabliſh it ſelfe in the object belov'd. To dote on a Picture is the worſt of Miſchiefs: There is no correſpondencie: The delight is fixt onely in the Eyes, and if we be affected, it is either with that which is not; or if there be any ſuch, it may be ſo adulterated, that it would rather occaſion Repentance then Love. But to be enamoured of Pictures, though it be a miſery to one, to you in particular it is portentous. This which you ſo highly eſteeme, hath expoſed you twice into danger of your life, and will occaſion you to loſe it, if you reſolve not to relinquiſh it. <hi>Dianea</hi> muſt not be yours, for ſo the ſupream Will hath decreed, which ſmiles at the ignorance of our Deſires. The Characters which I perceive in your fore-head, of the like whereof I have had a long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by my knowledge in the Science, agreeing with the courſe of the Heavens, deny you the Poſſeſſion of her. It will be a wiſedome ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your birth, which I know to be great, if you would abandon this humour which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169974:107"/>to the Gods. Your perill at Sea hath proved your happineſſe. The Divine Will knowes how to ſelect Antidotes out of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: So, forth of your owne Dangers doe you take notice of the power of the Stars.</p>
               <p>The Venerable old man ſpoke theſe and other things with ſo great a gravity, and ſo much E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, that he was able even to have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Rocks. I, who had not the heart to heare him proceed, beſeeched him to conclude, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging my ſelfe convicted; and gave him the Picture of <hi>Dianea,</hi> not to beare about me the Incendiary of my Evill. Within my ſelfe I remained aſtoniſhed at the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affections, alterable in all things; but in Loves lighter then fire, and more inconſtant then Motion. That Portraiture of <hi>Dianea</hi> which I had defended againſt the force of a world, and the Powers of a God, for which I had incenſed my Brother, forſaken my Father, and undertaken a voluntary Exile from my Countrey, I left in the hands of an old man, even vvith him who had had a reſolution to have torn it.</p>
               <p>I abode with him ſome few dayes, which I onely eſteem of as my life, being ſpent without any moleſtation. He was a Prince of great deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, who unwilling to ſuffer the miſeries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kinde, or the times, was retired into thoſe woods to enjoy himſelf. If he would have accepted of my Company, and had not perſwaded me to the contrary, demonſtrating to me the injuries I ſhould commit againſt my
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169974:107"/>hopes, and thoſe who ſtood in need of my aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Doubtleſſe I ſhould have continued there, to have enjoyed the contentments of that place, wherein a man in ſpight of Fortune and Envy might have been Patron of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</p>
               <p>I departed thence with as much griefe as could proceed from an heart obliged. I imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued in a Veſſell bound for <hi>Negrepont,</hi> when Armies and Souldiers made a Pompe of death, ſlaughter, and cruelty. The griefe of my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was allayed by the deſire I had to be an Actor in thoſe Warres, accounted the greateſt of the world. I came to the Court, where getting leave to ſerve as an Adventurer, I fell under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Lovaſtine,</hi> who was Generall of King <hi>Dinarderto's</hi> Forces, againſt the warlike King of the <hi>Veſati.</hi> Having there behaved my ſelfe not unworthy of my bloud, and particularly in the Battaile of <hi>Zenilp,</hi> and returning afterward to Court, I was Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Prodirto</hi> for his Companion, who after the Death of his Uncle altogether poſſeſſed the heart of his Majeſty; inſomuch, that hee ſolely had the Command of all things. There I became enamoured of the Princeſſe <hi>Floridea,</hi> whom although I knew not to be ſuperiour to <hi>Dianea</hi> in perfections, is nevertheleſſe owner of ſo much beautie, that I was compelled to preferre her to all, Dedicating my ſoule to her, which I offered up daily to her in beholding her.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:169974:108"/>
               <p>Truely, I had never any more opportunity of diſcloſing my affection to the Princeſſe then by my eyes; ſhe being inſtructed by Nature (as I imagine) returned me a correſpondency in ſuch manner, that I (who had but been accuſtomed to love Pictures) conceited my ſelfe to be called to the poſſeſſion of all the favours of love. My felicity had the quality of the Day-flies: For the Death of King <hi>Dinanderto</hi> enſuing, and thoſe Revolutions in the Kingdom (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be knowne to you) I could not enjoy my Loves, no not in an hope. When <hi>Prodirto</hi> attempted the ſtealing away of the Princeſſe, I became an Agent in that buſineſſe, aſſenting to it, having neither forces nor meanes to divert him.</p>
               <p>He would have related how they arrived in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and how he having got her, loſt her, but was interrupted by the Pilot, who came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, that they were purſued by a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats Ship, and that if it belonged to <hi>Mariſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> it was the leſſer evill to die then to be took; That he ſuſpected it the day before; for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſteere another way, that Veſſell did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſame; That while the winde continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he made no words of it, by reaſon that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from danger: but perceiving it to ceaſe, within a few houres they ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke. <hi>Celardo,</hi> and the other Knight, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to allay the Pilots teares, with ſaying, That the ſtrength of their Ship, ſo well provided for a fight, had no reaſon to be in feare of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169974:108"/>power of one onely veſſell. But he in more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour then before, becauſe the winde fell ſtill, anſwered:</p>
               <p>Sirs, if you were skilfull in Navigation, you would not certainly have have ſo great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. That without doubt which followes us, is <hi>Mariſcapi's</hi> the moſt brave one that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beheld on theſe Seas; not ſo much for the goodneſſe of it, and the ſtrength, as for the valour of the men that are within it. Simple people imagine it was built by Enchantment: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of a few Moneths, this moſt cruell man hath atchieved by force ſuch great matters, that his name is become a terrour to all that uſe theſe Seas. <hi>Celardo,</hi> and the other Knight, grew curious to know who this <hi>Mariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capi</hi> was. The Pilot after he had given dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fitting for their Defence, with thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, which are uſed in time of Fight, ſaid;</p>
               <p>Sirs, Between <hi>Sicilia</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barie,</hi> lies the Iſland of <hi>Melito.</hi> Some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand there (under an obligation) to deſtroy the Pirats of theſe Seas, more infeſted then others, by reaſon they are of an eaſier paſſage, and richer then other, by reaſon of a continuall Navigation. One of theſe is <hi>Mariſcapi,</hi> ſo named as I believe, that whoever would be ſecure from his Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhould avoid the Sea: He being covetous of Riches, and not content in that Degree where Fortune had placed him, and of Birth leſſe then ordinary, followes ſuch a courſe of life, as he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169974:109"/>himſelfe will not permit to Pirats. He is much worſe then they, for they remaine ſatisfied with Prizes; whilſt he alſo puts to death, for feare of being diſcovered. When he knowes he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conquer, he counterfeits himſelfe a friend, and afterwards obſerving his Times and Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, equally betraies all. Many times he hath been taken Priſoner, but hath ever had preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to defend and enlarge himſelfe, and returned after with greater pride, and an higher boldneſſe to ranſack theſe Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he reported this, they ſaw the Veſſell of <hi>Mariſcapi</hi> come ſo nigh them, that the Shouts (carried by the winde) arrived to their eares, though confuſed. It was but of an ordinary bigneſſe, but ſo well built and furniſhed, that a whole Fleet would have found it a difficulty to have taken it. With ſo ſtrange a ſpeed it plowed the Sea, that it could not be diſcerned, whether it moved the Windes, or was moved by them. It came to aſſault the ſhip, but with little hurt: although it made a Breach. The fight was unequall: for the ſhip in height ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Veſsell: But yet the valour and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Mariſcapi</hi> and his Souldiers was ſo great, that without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Celardo</hi> and that other Knight the ſhip had doubtleſs beene loſt. They fought ſmartly, having for their Object, the one their ſafety, and the others the booty. The Sea became red, and ſeemed as it were that it bluſhed at the ſhamefulneſses of thoſe men that came ſo wickedly to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169974:109"/>way their lives. <hi>Mariſcapi's</hi> Men made many Thundrings from their <hi>Baliſta's</hi> upon the ſhip, which by reaſon it was the higher, there was not a blow which did not great harme. On the other ſide, thoſe in the Veſsel with their Arrows, and their wild-fires, made a ſlaughter of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>The fight had not been determined without the death of all, if the Winde, that til now had been quiet at this ſpectacle, had not fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Contention. The Waves ſwell'd, and the Clouds gathered: they began to blow ſo violently, that thoſe that fought were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by maine force to retire. The ſhip that was the leſſe able to reſiſt the violences of Heavens Anger, perſwaded the Pilot to come aſhore in a Rock, which was the beginning of an Iſland. <hi>Celardo,</hi> and that other knight, unwilling to adventure themſelves more to the inconſtancy of the Sea, reſolved to travaile by Land, untill ſome Accident ſhould preſcribe them what to doe. Whilſt they paſſed onward into the Iſland, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any body who could acquaint them with what they deſired; <hi>Celardo</hi> beſeeched the Knight to make him partaker of his Adventures, hee having not refuſed to doe the ſame to him.</p>

               <head>The Historie of <hi>Oſſirdo.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Refuſe not (Sir Prince) the Knight reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve you, and ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my infelicities have received originall from the Princeſſe <hi>Dianea,</hi> who hath been alſo the occaſion of yours. <hi>Iſland</hi> is my Countrey, an Iſland ſituated under the Artick Pole, betweene <hi>Auſter</hi> and <hi>Boreas,</hi> neare the frozen Sea: in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times (for the remoteneſſe of it) having been called the loſt Iſland. <hi>Aſpane,</hi> who there governes the Scepter, is my Father. My name is <hi>Offirdo,</hi> his onely ſonne, beloved of the King, and reverenced by the Kingdome, as ſucceſsour to the Crowne. Having attained to that age, wherein Idleneſſe is wont to beget Repentance, I reſolved to forſake the Eaſineſses of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to acquire ſome applauſe from the voices of Fame. <hi>Iſland,</hi> for the remoteneſs of it is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Ambition of thoſe Monarchs, who out of a Deſire to enlarge their Dominions, have a Courage to raiſe Warre againſt the ſtarres.</p>
               <p>My Deſigne being laid, without further delay I put it in Execution, making a Voiage to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> where unknown I came aſhore, although that King was neare to my Father, both by bloud and affection. Continuing there ſome certaine dayes in Court, I fixed my thoughts upon the Princeſs <hi>Doricia,</hi> an owner of ſo ſingular Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that (ſave onely in whiteneſs) ſhe yielded
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169974:110"/>not to <hi>Dianea,</hi> Nature peradventure was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to declare, that ſhee can exerciſe her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in all colours: And that in many Objects ſhadowes are not at all inferiour to Lights. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricia</hi> being aſsured of my Affection, was prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall to me of all thoſe favours which belong to a Princeſs. It was an envy to thoſe of the Court to ſee themſelves out-ſtripped by one, who the laſt of all became her ſervant.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Gotlandia</hi> not enduring to ſee himſelfe excluded, or to ſuffer me his Rivall, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any Treacherie to deprive me of my life. But I knew with ſo good fortune to defend my ſelfe, that almoſt alwayes he was in petill to loſe his owne. One day, with all the Court, we were returned from Hunting. I before any others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Duke endeavoured it, took hold of <hi>Doricia's</hi> Bridle. The Duke could not refraine ſaying to me; Knight, yours is a great raſhneſs, who come to raviſh thoſe places of honour, to which thoſe durſt hardly aſpire, who would ſcorne to be ſerved by you. Duke, (I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him) I pardon you this boldneſs, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence I bear to the Princeſs my Lady. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time this ſword ſhall ſhew you the diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality that is between your merit and mine. The Duke advanced his hand to have ſtrucken me, but I eſcaping it, by ſtepping a foot back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at the firſt blow ranne him acroſs into the Boſome. This Encounter diſpleaſed the King, who upon it was neceſſitated to forbid me the Court; from which alſo I got ſpeedily farre
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169974:111"/>away, untill Ambaſsadours ſhould be come from my Father, who arrived preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty lamented that I had not revealed my ſelfe ſooner; and granting the Princeſs to me for wife, preparations for thoſe ſhowes were begun, which they deſigned to have moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. All Artificers were employed, neither was there any Knight, though but of a meane condition, who prepared not himſelf againſt the Glories of thoſe Feaſts. Irons and Marbles ſweat to exalt to eternity joyes of ſuch greatneſs. In this while, the Fame of <hi>Dianea's</hi> Beauties were divulged. In Court they were diſcourſed of at large, with an infinity of Encomiums. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I replyed unto them with no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits but ſuch as the univerſall Report did admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. One day when I was in my lodgings, a Letter was preſented to me, and importunity expreſsed for an Anſwer.

               <p>Recommending my Letter to the Meſſenger, I retired into my Lodgings full, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of confuſion or repentance. I thought it a foule unworthineſs to betray under my hand the affections of <hi>Dianea.</hi> And I could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it an ingratitude to refuſe her a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, at leaſt by Letters. But when my thoughts were fixed upon my engagements to the beauties of <hi>Doricia,</hi> I tormented my ſelfe with reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo lively, that ſighs and teares were the leaſt ſignes of my affection. I accuſed Love, who to diſquiet the repoſes of my felicity had enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the mind of <hi>Dianea</hi> to affect me. I curſed Fortune, who to diſturbe my deſires had preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Treaſures to me which I might not obtaine. Finally, I blamed the vanity of my thoughts, the inconſtancy of my affections, which could not fixe upon that object which by the oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of correſpondency, the rules of fidelity, the merit of beauty ought to be preferred to any other.</p>
               <p>To eaſe me of my griefe I entered into <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricias</hi> Lodgings; A heart receiving no greater refreſhment than from the ſurvey of an excellent Countenance. I found her in bed, as it were dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, encompaſſed round by her Ladies, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented over her as dead. Her face was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169974:113"/>with a mortall colour, by it to demonſtrate the ſadneſſe of her heart. Her eyes were ſhut, neither did ſhe open them but to vent forth her teares. Her tongue could not deliver a plaine word, prevented, I beleeve, by her ſighs which buried them in her mouth. Her lips, having loſt their ſcarlet and purple, appeared as if they were over-ſpread with aſhes by thoſe moſt ardent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations which proceeded from her heart. Her hands rebelling againſt the reſt of her body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually attempted to teare her hair &amp; do injuries againſt her face: or rather they ſtrooke her breaſt, as to breake it open, that evaporating the fire ſhe might be moleſted with a leſſer torment. At ſo funebrous a ſpectacle I could not refraine from griefe, which then is not counterfeit when it is provoled by pity and affection. Taking her by the hand I beſeeched of her the occaſion of her malady. Fixing her eyes on my countenance, after breathing forth ſome ſighs, as harbingers of her paſſion, ſhe ſaid:</p>
               <p>Perfidious man, doſt thou alſo endeavour by a diſſembling pity to deceive me? Doſt thou ſhew a reſentment of that evill which thou only haſt procured? Wherein hath the unfortunate <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> demerited thy affections? What errour have I committed worthy of a puniſhment ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentfull? What motive perſwaded thee to come and diſturbe the quiet of my heart, whileſt thou intendeſt to betray me? Lament deſpiſed beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the funerall of your ambition, ſince you have been deſired, and courted, not to be enjoyed but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169974:114"/>ſlighted; unhappy <hi>Dorieia!</hi> to whom haſt thou engaged thy mind? Even to one who knows not how to love himſelfe, and was borne under that heaven where the ſeas are frozen. Her teares ſtopt her words; whereupon I proteſting my affection, by an Imprecation of all the Gods, and my loyalty: I beſeeched het not ſo much to wrong her ſelfe by declaring me guilty before the cauſe was known: That the examples of the ſeas are not to be compared with thoſe of the heart, much rather becauſe the mountaines of <hi>Iſland,</hi> although covered with a perpetuall ſnow, give nouriſhment alſo to a continuall fire within. Laſtly, I added it was a property of thoſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray who were too fearefull to be deceived, and who are free from love cannot be perſwaded of the affections of others.</p>
               <p>At theſe words ſhe being no longer able to containe her ſelfe, calling me many times by the name of perfidious and traitour, ſhewed me the Letter I had writ to <hi>Dianea;</hi> adding, With what excuſes (O wicked man) canſt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe thy Treachery? Wouldſt thou have other teſtimonies to convince thee then thoſe from thy own hand, &amp; from thy own very Characters? I then perceiving my fault to reprove me, which afflicted my conſcience, wiſhed my ſelfe rather confronted by a thouſand Souldiers with any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill to my life. I endeavoured to appeaſe her with entreaties, with promiſes, and with invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the teſtimony of the Gods, That in the dictating of that Letter I had had no other fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169974:114"/>but that of my hand. All my atteſtations proved fruitleſſe; whereupon deſpairing, ſeeing her ſo eſtranged, I laid hold of my Poynard to have ſlaine my ſelfe. I would have done it, ſo great was the repentance I received from her Reprovings, and her teares, She her ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me; ſaying:</p>
               <p>I will that you ſhould know the ſuperiority that I have above you in loving; That although theſe be feigned expreſſions I will beleeve them, and prevent them as if true. But yet I deſerved not ſo great a mortification loving you to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. Having ſurvayed your praiſes of <hi>Dianea</hi> with ſuch a partiality ſung from your mouth, I have had an experience of your infidelity, but with ſo grand a paſſion, that I had rather have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than endured it. The Letter that came to you under <hi>Dianea's</hi> name was dictated by me to make tryall of your Loyalty. The Gods for my happineſſe put this in my thoughts, that I might not undergo a Tyrannie in the inconſtancy of your affections.</p>
               <p>I ſuffered her not to proceed in theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but ſaid, That to tempt the fidelity of a man approved faithfull was an offence to the Gods, That my Letter was a token of my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, not a witneſſe of my affection. That ſhe her ſelfe would not have writ otherwiſe to any great Prince, that towards her had uſed termes ſo courteous. To theſe, and many other reaſons, I added ſuch ſignes of humility, that in a great meaſure I calmed her diſdaine: And there is not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169974:115"/>truly any thing more powerfull over the heart of a woman. Time that affords remedies to the moſt deſperate evils exalted me into my former condition, although in ſome kind ſhe forbore not to taxe me. A jealous Lady is a torment ſo much the more, if ſhe hath reaſons ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by.</p>
               <p>Our Nuptials were celebrated with that ſumptuouſneſſe as is fully proper to the Greatneſs of a King. The Juſts, the Turnaments, and the Feaſts were infinite; honoured by the preſence and aſſiſtance of ſuch Knights and Princes, that all acknowledged there were never ſeen richer in the Kingdome of <hi>Norway.</hi> Two daies only remaining dedicated to the ſolemnitie of my Eſpouſals, when Fortune (troubled with an envy at my contentment) brought a Knight to the Court, who entreated publike audience: And being brought in, he ſo ſpoke in the preſence of the King.</p>
               <p>I am <hi>Hydraſpe</hi> Prince of <hi>Hibernia,</hi> an Iſland of the Ocean Sea. Whileſt I remained enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quietneſſe of my Countrey, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of command, Love came to diſturbe me. He made uſe of a Portraiture of <hi>Dianea,</hi> which happening into <hi>Ireland</hi> obtained more hearts, which gave up their Liberties to it, than it met with eyes that unconquerably could behold it. It was accompanied with two other Pictures, which peradventure might have been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more than handſome, if <hi>I</hi> had not looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Paragon ſo exceeding them. <hi>Dianea</hi> then
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169974:115"/>being made the Idoll of my pleaſures, in ſuch manner poſſeſſed my mind, that the repoſes of the night, and all the houres of the day were beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Adoration of that beauty. My mother fuller of pity than diſcretion, hoping to take that from my heart which diſturbed my ſight, made it be ſtolne from me at ſuch a time as <hi>I</hi> could not prevent her. Being offended at my mother, and and angry at my ſelf, <hi>I</hi> departed with an intention to go to <hi>Cyprus</hi> and get her for my wife; The death of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Armenia</hi> being alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged with us. But being to appeare before the <hi>Idea</hi> of beauty, <hi>I</hi> reſolved to apparell my ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der habiliments of deſert, by bearing to <hi>Dianea</hi> ſome teſtimonies of my valour. In all Courts whereſoever <hi>I</hi> have yet arrived, <hi>I</hi> have defended againſt all Knights that affirme the contrary, That <hi>Dianea</hi> is the Queene of beautie, and that to mention her an equall was to maintaine the wrong, and defraud from juſtice. Our weapons ſhall be according to the pleaſure of the Knights; The conquered ſhall leave their names with thoſe of the Ladies whom they ſerve.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpoke the Prince of <hi>Hibernia</hi> with an amazement to all the Court, which laught at the folly of a man, who ran his life into hazard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a thing, which not only was not in his power, but whom to attaine he could ſcarcelie reach at by hope. He was ſuddenlie welcomed by his Majeſtie, who appointed him a very rich Pavillion in the moſt conſpicuous place of the Grand <hi>Piazza.</hi> He raiſing up there a little Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169974:116"/>affixed upon it this Inſcription.</p>
               <p>Dianea <hi>the Princeſs of</hi> Cyprus <hi>is Queene of beauty. She ſurpaſſes in favour all other Ladies, as</hi> Venus <hi>is the moſt comely among all the Goddeſſes. She would contend for priority with the Sun it ſelfe, if he by a perpetuall motion did not avoid the Compariſon. Whoever to their own misfortune will not credit this, he ſhall find it made good by the Armes of a Knight, the Prince of</hi> Hibernia. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be the reward of the Conquerours; and the puniſhment of the overcome ſhall be to leave his own name, and that of his Miſtriſſe.</hi>

               <p>All that day there was not any body that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Juſt, every one attending to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into order to chaſtiſe an enterprize, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the moſt raſh that could be undertaken by a Knight. The Sun had hardly participated of his light to our Hemiſphere, but many appeared to combate the Knight: I will omit the particulars of the Turnament, not to trouble you with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſo ſuperfluous. Not ſo, replied <hi>Celardo,</hi> I have a very great curioſity for it, and the rather becauſe our travell is ſweetned by ſuch diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. With your Hiſtory we have advanced a great way without any tediouſneſs: And truly, being raviſhed with the pleaſure of your diſcourſe, and the varietie of your Chances, I have not felt any imaginable wearineſs. Behold I am ready, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Oſſirdo,</hi> to ſatisfie you: And I do it ſo much the willinger, becauſe thoſe things are ſo imprinted in my memory that I figure them as preſent.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:169974:116"/>
               <p>The firſt that enter'd into the Liſts was the Duke of <hi>Scandia,</hi> a young man, who, if he had had as much valour as he had wealth, would have been invincible. He bore an <hi>Icarus</hi> in his Shield, which he imitated by falling at the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and grieved that he could not do it in all things by reaſon he found the earth too hard, and would much rather have been buried in the ſea, than have received ſo great a diſgrace in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſo many Princes. He left the name of <hi>Arcea</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cimbria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Lupponia</hi> preſently ſupplied his place, who ever hitherto from all Gioſts came off with honour. The Emprefle of his ſhield was one diſguiſed with this Motto, Fain'd, I faine. At the firſt encounter with their Launces he in a manner equalled the Prince; at the ſecond they both hit upon the breaſt, although with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to the Count who was a little diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Taking new Speares they came to the third, angry at themſelves that they had not been able to overcome, The Prince was a little wounded in his arme, becauſe the Lance glancing from his ſhield unbroken ſtuck in his vantbrace. The Count was caſt forth of his ſaddle with ſo great a fall, that all thought him dead. He was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to leave the name of <hi>Creſia,</hi> a Damzell of the Queenes, who received more ſorrow to ſee her Knight ſo handled, than ſhe did for the loſs of the quarrell for her beauty.</p>
               <p>That day the Prince would fight no more, both by reaſon it was late, and alſo becauſe the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169974:117"/>wound on his arme pained him. The morning following he appeared armed whileſt many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and requeſted the battell. In little more than two houres he unhorſed fix at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, with ſo much facility, that he aſtoniſhed all the Court, becauſe they were Knights of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation. The Dukes of <hi>Filtra</hi> and of <hi>Nidroſia:</hi> The Counts of <hi>Finmarca,</hi> and of <hi>Berge:</hi> And the Barons of <hi>Nagardia,</hi> and of <hi>Hanima;</hi> they left the names of <hi>Gelaſia, Andrena, Filarta, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina, Polimena, Floralta,</hi> even all Damzels belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Queene.</p>
               <p>After dinner there appeared a Knight in the Liſts in black Armour with ſtuds of Gold, who was unknown to all. He bore for his ſigne a Sun Dyall: which ſhewed it is life and motion. The Prince taking his Lance ran to meet him with ſo violent a force, that he made him bow ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whileſt he loſt one of his ſtirrups. Being both enflamed with indignation they tooke ſecond Lances, running as ſwift as their Horſes could. The unknown Knight with ſo much courage ſtrooke the Prince, that he was compelled (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void falling) to embrace his horſes neck, whileſt the Prince with ſuch a fury hit him on the Helmet, that he ſtrook it from his head. All ſtood amazed at this encounter, and the rather becauſe that Knight was Known to be a <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Lady, who a long time had waited on her Majeſty. She cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed her countenance with a fierce beauty, and manifeſted that ſtrength might reigne in that Sex (which upon a falſe preſuppoſition) was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:169974:117"/>the more weake. She, not acknowledging her ſelf overcome, laid hand to her ſword, adding; Knight, although I have loſt my Armes, I have not alſo my underſtanding, which obliges me to defend the beauties of the Ladies of this Court. The advantage you have over me will more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly demonſtrate the injuſtice of your Cauſe. The Prince, bluſhing to have found ſo much ſtrength in a woman, anſwered: Faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I ought not to combate with you, for my quarrell extends no farther than againſt man: And beſides, if I ought, I would not fight, you having the advantage by having your face unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, which hath a power to conquer me equall to your hands.</p>
               <p>Upon this there entred into the place the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Macina,</hi> the proudeſt Knight that I had ever ſeene. His originall was from the Vulgar, although he daily vaunted of Nobility. He ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all, and both in Letters and Armes concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe without an equall. He ran to his ſervice, whoſoever ſought to him, and for any vile hopes ſlighted the Laws of honour and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. He rode upon a horſe all black ſave his forehead, which was marked with foure ſtars, which even compelled all eyes to ſuppoſe them ſilver. His Armes were moſt rich, but gained by deceit and rapine. For his Impreſſe he bore a Leopard, which ſaid, If I overcome not, I do not follow. The two firſt Encounters were equall, no advantage appearing. In the third, as the Prince paſſed on without receiving the leaſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169974:118"/>dammage, the Baron fell, his horſe falling down dead under him. He ſuddenly drew his ſword, and ſaid, I ought not to receive blame for the faults of my horſe; with my ſword I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Prerogatives of the beauty that I adore Alight therefore if you would not that I ſhould commit a crime not uſuall between Knights. The Prince lighted, anſwering him, Although there is no reaſon that ſhould compell me to combate with you having unhorſed you: yet I will remove from you any pretence that you may not excuſe the injuſtice you maintaine. So ſaying, he ſtrooke ſuch a blow upon his helme, that if it had not been of a finer temper than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that had determined the Quarrell. He for all that, not loſing a jot of his vigour, gave the Prince ſuch a thruſt, that his Armour being broke with it, he wounded him in the Flanke, conceived conſiderable for the bloud that ran from it. The Prince, after many blows given and received, foreſeeing that the victory conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the celerity, feigning to ſtrike him on the head, whileſt he held advanced his Shield and Sword, ran him through the body. The Baron dying fell downe, ſo that the Prince had not time to receive the name of the beauty that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. His death was only diſtaſtefull to the Ladies, for they were in hope he might have been the Victor. There were none elſe in the Court that felt any reſentment at his death, for his pride had rendred him hatefull, even to thoſe who had made him great.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:169974:118"/>
               <p>The Prince went out of the field to dreſſe his wounds, which for fifteene daies enforced him to keep his bed. Being recovered, there was not any body that would adventure themſelves; the example of the Baron having admoniſhed the moſt undaunted not to endanger themſelves in a matter where the reward did not paralell the perill. Two daies he had remained idle, when on the third a Knight appeared who demanded to Juſt, imagined of great Nobility by the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Servants, and the richneſſe of his Armes. He wore an upper-garment all ſtudded with gold and pearle. The Impreſſe in his Shield was a death which held an Olive in his hands. They took the field, and ran the Courſe at the full ſpeed of their horſes. The Knight ſmote the Prince on the Helmet with ſo impetuous a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that bowing himſelfe firſt on the right ſide, then on the left, he was enforced to fall: On the other ſide he was ſtrooke by the Prince on the Shield, which being of the pureſt ſteele, making the Speare to glide to his breaſt, and that (with a Coat of Maile, not having ſufficient reſiſtance againſt the aſſault of an hand rendred by Deſtiny more cruell than ordinary) was pierced from one ſide to the other, exhaling his ſoule with his blood. The ſorrow of all was very great, but more eſpecially when they knew him to be Lord of the Iſland of <hi>Tarpaſia.</hi> He was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth of the field by his, who by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations would have moved pity in the Aire, and with their teares have violated even breaſts of braſſe.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:169974:119"/>
               <p>Two daies after, the Prince perceiving that none anſwered to his challenge, appointed his departure. He made his reſolution to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by ſound of Trumpet, with a grand reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Ladies of the Court, who accounted as ſtolne from their merit as much of glory as was added to <hi>Dianea's</hi> name. One Evening fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Doricia</hi> even drowned in a grievous ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I enquired what might be the cauſe of her ſadneſſe. Before ſhe would anſwer me, ſhe made that her ſighs and teares ſhould captivate the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of my heart, the more eaſily to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it. Afterwards (I know not whether ſpeaking or weeping) ſhe ſaid to me:</p>
               <p>I bemoane not theſe deſpiſed beauties as too poore to have Champions: For that deſerveth not teares which is not worthy of defence. But I lament at my little fortune that hath rendred me ſubject to one who hath an heart to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as ſlighted. How (I beſeech you) can you love me, if with a ſilent allowance you ſuffer injuries which are directly aimed at me? Sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are ſolely admitted againſt thoſe things which ſhould be ſlighted. And how ſhould I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you that endure me to be neglected before my eyes? He deſerves not love who demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates not his affection by the Effects. Let your memory preſent to it ſelfe, when with adulterate leaſings of above humane Titles you attempted to beguile the ſimplicity of my Genius. Then the power of a world would have been too weake againſt the ſtrength of your arme. At the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169974:119"/>preſent, now poſſeſſion hath cooled or cloy'd your deſire, one only man is ſufficient to beget feares in that mind which could not have been terrified. I condemne your Judgement that have not the boldneſſe to defend her, to whom you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged your ſoule to love her. Whileſt you cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me for a Wife you would have moved a rock, and now to maintaine my honour you languiſh in Idleneſſe. 'Tis true, that the beauties of <hi>Dianea</hi> (augmented perchance by an Hyperbolicall Fame) exceed the compariſon of mine, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a ſlighting: but you not withſtanding are obliged to defend them againſt a <hi>Venus.</hi> Having elected them, wherefore refuſe you to protect them; you ſcare peradventure to combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what is juſt, you deceive your ſelfe. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath no other reaſon but that of the eyes: nor can he be accuſed of injuſtice who defends that he loves. I will not taxe you of Cowardice, as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Knight who hath been almoſt vanquiſhed by a woman, although to me your actions declare you ſuch, not to do a wrong to my choice. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplicate you, that you permit not one ſole man to depart hence vaineglorious by a reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Ladies of this Court. But you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps affecting <hi>Dianea,</hi> would for her merit that our Diſgraces ſhould adde glories to her Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. The more I reflect on your thought, ſo much the more it confirmes me. He knows not how to love me who knows not how to guard me from injuries. If this be true, wherefore would you betray me? Aime not to carry me
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169974:120"/>into <hi>Iſland,</hi> for I cannot be ſecure of my life with him who would not deliver me from ſcornes.</p>
               <p>She would have ſpoke more, if teares and ſighs accompanying her words to vent her paſſion, had not deſtroyed them as ſoone as they were borne. I remained ſo repleat with affliction, that if the temembrance of my State had not ſtopt my teares, they would have falne in an abundance. I know not by what Fatality I was withheld from fighting againſt the Prince of <hi>Hibernia.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that ſince I had had the Fortune to be your Companion, you have not perceived in me any ſignes of a baſe mind, and yet then I had not the courage to lay hand on my ſword. I know not if the imagination that <hi>Dianea's</hi> beauty was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riout to that of <hi>Doricia</hi> occaſioned that averſion in me; or rather that ſome Devill diverted me from that fight. Nevertheleſſe I enforced my ſelfe to convince <hi>Doricia</hi> with words, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the heart to give her ſatisfaction by my actions, I ſaid to her:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doricia,</hi> you mortifie my affection, whileſt being engaged in marriage, you have an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to entice eies with your beauties, and whileſt you have a deſire that they ſhould be publiſhed. The face of a wife ſhould not pretend to more than to meet the ſatisfaction of her husband. She is not more comely but by that heart by which ſhe hath been judged and choſen for the moſt handſome; your beauty henceforth is not to be ſubmitted to opinion nor cenſure. If I
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169974:120"/>ſhould maintaine it againſt the follies of the Prince of <hi>Hibernia,</hi> the danger will be greater than the profit. If I ſhould conquer, I ſhould gaine nothing but a confirmation of my own thought, which hath made choice of you as the moſt beautifull of this Age. If Fortune ſhould rob from me the Palme of victory, what a griefe would mine be? I ſhould be accuſed of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, for being more willing to give credit to the force of my ſword, then to the undeceivable judgement of my eies. I ſhould imagine my ſelf worthy of reproaches from all mouths whileſt I ſhould defend the beautie of thoſe things which are mine. Give way to others to ſpeake your praiſes: The Encomiums of thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed render merit ſuſpected. Woe be to that husband who deſires that the <hi>Piazza</hi> ſhould be the Theater of his wives beautie, and would that an univerſall Fame ſhould ſervefor an Eccho to the Glories of her Countenance. He loves that beautie little, who publiſhing it makes it more coveted and ſubject to Rapine. He is very poore of deſert, who thinkes not himſelfe alone ſufficient to comprehend the beauties of his wife. Who ſo publiſhes the comlineſſe of her whom he loves, or would have Companions, or is diſtruſtfull of himſelfe, or his own opinion, had need of teſtimony from others. That Face wants not proofes, nor defences, which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no greater prejudice than to ſee it ſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to doubt. If I ſhould maintaine your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt the Prince of <hi>Hibernia,</hi> I ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169974:121"/>you equall to <hi>Dianea,</hi> whileſt by all others you would be accounted much her ſuperiour. I affect not ſo little the Delicacies of <hi>Doricia,</hi> as I would gaine them Paragons, nor adventure them in a battell, which for the moſt part is over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Fortune. Thoſe things are vile which are hazarded to the Arbitrements of Conquerours. If you be wiſe, argue my affection from hence, who not to put your beauty into a doubt am content in your opinion to be reckoned for a Coward.</p>
               <p>With theſe, and ſuch like conceits I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſatisfie her. She had no mind to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me, being doubly afflicted, both with her griefe, and my words: And ſtuck in an opinion that I affected <hi>Dianea,</hi> and could not find any meanes to undeceive her. After he had ſtaid ſixe daies in a vaine expectation of Combatants, the Prince of <hi>Hibernia</hi> departed. And ſoone after I likewiſe determined upon going. <hi>Doricia</hi> went with me in obedience to the Laws of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and the Commands of her Father. She would rather have died than departed thence, if ſhe had not ſcared the Cenſure of the World. Being arrived in <hi>Iſland,</hi> there was not any thing I omitted whereby I might rejoyce her, and free her from her ſo vaine ſuſpitions.</p>
               <p>She was even convinced, and thenceforward, laying aſide the ſadneſſes of her mind, ſhe was pleaſed with the expreſſions of my affection at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending her abroad a Fiſhing, of which our Iſland abounds above all other things. To this ſhe would come with much content, we lying purpoſelie
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169974:121"/>for ſome daies upon the ſhore. Then alſo ſhe took pleaſure to view the wonders of the Iſland, which even puzzle Faith, and render the relation of them ſuſpitious.</p>
               <p>All the Crows there are milke-white, and the Jay's utter an humane voice. <hi>Iſland</hi> hath there high hills, on the tops of which lies a perpetuall ſnow, and the bottomes give nouriſhment to a continuall fire. There are likewiſe foure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, a ſtones caſt diſtance one from the other, all of contrary qualities. The water of one is hotter than fire: And of another ſo cold that it cannot be endured. The third is pleaſant to the taſte, and phyſicall; and the fourth ranke poyſon. But all theſe Marvels, of which Nature may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yield to a voraginous place, about the banks of which thoſe men appeare that have periſhed by a violent death.</p>
               <p>One morning (but againſt my will) <hi>Doricia</hi> ſtay'd there, looking on a Damſell, who with a loud voice called brother. He ſuddenly appeared, and had not been thought a Ghoſt if ſhe had not embraced him. He was demanded by her the cauſe of his death: And anſwered, that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme an acceptable ſervice to Prince <hi>Oſſirdo,</hi> he with ſome friends went to the Kingdome of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> to ſteale <hi>Dianea</hi> thence. That they having got notice ſhe was to repaire to a Fountaine, there waited to have taken her. The performance had crowned the Deſigne, if the unexpected comming in of a Knight had not deprived them all of their lives.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:169974:122"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doricia,</hi> her old jealouſies being awakened, at theſe words (perhaps perſwading her ſelfe, that this man by my appointment went into <hi>Cyprus</hi>) began to provoke me with injuries ſo perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that I could not abſtaine from curſing my Fortune, which I found daily in a readineſſe to moleſt my Repoſes. I often offered to interrupt her, and plead my excuſes, but her out-cries gave not an opportunity to my reaſons. Finally, the unhappy <hi>Doricia,</hi> not longer able to endure her ſorrow, ran (for what ever I could do) to the Fountaine of poyſon, and taking a draught of it fell preſently down dead. I (although it be a ſpecies of Felicity to be rid of a jealous wife) took ſo great a diſcontent at it, that I fell into a ſickneſſe that endangered my life.</p>
               <p>Theſe newes being brought into the King of <hi>Norway's</hi> Court, he was ſo offended, that (for all my Embaſſadours could ſay) raiſing a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Army, he came to the harrowing of our Iſland. I having in the firſt battell found For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune averſe, fled away diſguiſed, eſteeming it as a folly to tempt againe that Deſtinie who had ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more declared her ſelfe my enemy. My Father yielded, having not Forces to reſiſt. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour mollified by his teares, or rather aſſured of my innocencie, confirmed his Kingdome to him, reſerving to himſelfe the Homage for it. I had no mind afterwards to returne into <hi>Iſland:</hi> but travell up and down the world with an hope to ſee the malignitie of thoſe influences changed, which have hitherto continuallie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me to miſery.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:169974:122"/>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Oſſirdo</hi> made this Relation of his adventures, they heard ſome voices, which, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken between thoſe Trees, allowed not a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whether they were the effects of joy or ſorrow. Mending their Pace, they deſcried a Pallace, which being ſhone on by the ſecond Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of heaven, to their eies appeared maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall. They heard plainly Lamentations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon perſwading themſelves ſome violence was acted, they deſired to be admitted in. They were ſcarce up ſtaires, but entred into a Roome where they ſaw five ſo neare dying, that with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they might be termed Carkaſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oleandro</hi> and <hi>Arnalta</hi> were ſoone known by them. After they had ſuffered thoſe teares to fall which ſo miſerable an Accident deſerved, they enquired of the Damſels what was the occaſion of ſo much evill. Underſtanding it to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Celardo</hi> remembring he had about him the Medal againſt poyſon, which <hi>Arnalta</hi> in her haſte at parting had ſorgotten, took it, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upon the breaſt of <hi>Oleandro,</hi> he ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſenſes. He nevertheleſſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately continued his Lamentations againſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which preſerved him in life that he might be eternally miſerable. Oppreſſed with ſorrow, he had not ſo much underſtanding as to know <hi>Celardo.</hi> He believed Nature had made reſiſtance againſt the poyſon, and eſteemed it an addition to his wretchedneſſe, that he could not dye. But this affliction was ſoone paſſed over; for the Medal, which was a ſtone, called by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169974:123"/>Bezoardica,</hi> made the ſame effect upon all the reſt, freeing them out of the hands of death.</p>
               <p>The joyes and embracings cannot be expreſt. Tired with ſo many doubled and centuplicated ſignes of conſolation and affection, they gave thankes to <hi>Celardo,</hi> and <hi>Oſſirdo,</hi> acknowledging themſelves obliged to them for their lives. Here renewing their thankes, they knew one another. Only <hi>Arelida</hi> accuſing the ſtarres, and the Gods as Authors of her infelicitie, provoked a pity with her moanes, even in thoſe that ought to have hated her. She ſaid:</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible (O Fortune) that thou haſt dreſt thy head, and rent thy ſailes not to tranſport elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the wofull effects of thy malignitie. Is it poſſible that I ſhould find alſo the Deſtinies inexorable againſt my death? Is it poſſible that death, who ſatiates not his deſires with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Carkaſſes, declares himſelfe nauſeous to my life? I am ſo miſerable, that even Hell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes me. Unhappy <hi>Arelida,</hi> for an adjunct to whoſe miſeries the World, Heavens, and the Gods have changed Nature. Love hath rendred thee odious, Iron cannot kill thee, Theeves flye from thee, the Sea vomits thee up, Poyſon works not to effect thy revenge, nor to withdraw thee from the ſcornes of thy enemies. O Knights, what wicked Acts have you pitifully exerciſed againſt me! If with divine remedies you can animate the dead, you ſhould not therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thoſe that only in death ſuppoſe their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169974:123"/>I have not an heart that can live oppreſſed with ſo many infelicities. But preſently you ſhall ſee the effects of your pity. <hi>Oleandro, Ariama,</hi> why delay you to run me through? Why delay you to revenge your ſelves? Behold the hated, behold the abandoned <hi>Arelida,</hi> who lived till now only to ſee you die. The hate which my unhappineſſe neceſſitates me to beare you is that which hitherto hath kept me alive. I have not lived to live, I have lived to hate you. To what end then ſtay you; Kill me, kill me. Behold my breaſt, behold my heart, which for their dotages merit juſtice from your hands, and with reaſon crueltie from your ſwords. Since my follies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not the honourable puniſhment of your diſdaine, afford me your ſwords, which very well know how to deliver me from the Tyrannie of Deſtinie. It doth not agree with your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to permit me to live who cannot but hate you.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe was ſilent, I beleeve to give leiſure to her eies, that they alſo might preſent the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her ſoule. <hi>Oleandro</hi> with that gentleneſs which is proper to a native Prince, with his teares compaſſionated the miſeries of ſuch a Princeſſe. Not enduring that with ſo deſperate conceits ſhe ſhould ſpeake of her ſelfe, he ſaid to her:</p>
               <p>Princeſſe <hi>Arelida,</hi> it is time to calme your mind, accommodating it to the will of heaven, which many times inſtructs us by an appearance of evill. The remembrance of paſt things ſhall
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169974:124"/>be buried in oblivion, whileſt <hi>Ariama</hi> and I will have no other memory but of an Obligation to ſerve you. It is not convenient that revenge ſhould reigne in that breaſt where the Graces inhabit. If Fortune hath been willing to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you, ſhew that your conſtancy can triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the malignity of Fortune, and that out of Iron and fire you have recovered health. The Kingdome of <hi>Numidia</hi> deplores your abſence. The declining age of your Father beſeeches you not to abandon him, deſirous to felicitate the horrours of death with your preſence. But if theſe reaſons are not prevalent to dry away your teares; if revenge overcomes your reaſon, if your ſadneſſes cannot admit of comfort but by the determination of my life; if laſtly the hatred you beare me will give no leiſure to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the love which you have borne me, behold my ſword, behold my head, ſatiate your ſelfe, kill me, cut me to peeces. I had rather die than live hated by you. It is againſt my dutie that I ſhould permit that a Princeſſe ſhould hate me without being able to vent it. So ſaying, he gave her his ſword, and kneeling laid his head on her Lap.</p>
               <p>She fetching a deep ſigh, and throwing away the ſword raiſed him up, ſaying to him: <hi>Olean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi> with how many ſorts of weapons do you know to overcome your enemies. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe vanquiſhed, and from henceforth will change the Altar of Revenge into that of Oblivion. I will meditate occaſions to ſerve you,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169974:124"/>as I have formerly ſtudied waies to deſtroy you. I receive <hi>Ariama</hi> for my ſiſter, and beſeech both of you to pardon the follies of an enamoured ſoule, which untill now had not any knowledge by reaſon. I commend my Kingdome to you two, being unwilling to forſake this houſe, which hath proved the cauſe that I can compoſe my mind to live in quiet. I have no ambition for a Kingdome, which finally will do nothing but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe me and impoveriſh me. There is no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier reigning than over ones own affections. Theſe hence forward ſhall with all my power be kept under to prevent me from encountring er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which till now have prepared precipices for me.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, ſhe embraced <hi>Ariama</hi> with ſuch an Affection, that it gave not, no not a ſigne to have received at any time any imaginable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Turning afterwards to <hi>Celardo</hi> and the others, ſhe ſaid to them: Pardon me (Sirs) that till now, oppreſt with my paſſions, I have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that entertainment which is due to all, but in particular to thoſe who have conferred benefits. I will endeavour to ſupply it with ſo much the more affection. Then ſhe made ſome meats to be got ready, the Sun being advanced far in his courſe. Foure daies this moſt noble Company continued with the Princeſſe <hi>Arelida,</hi> without being able to perſwade her to returne to her Kingdome of <hi>Numidia.</hi> Towards which <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro, Ariama, Arnalta,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Olano</hi> parted. <hi>Celardo</hi> and <hi>Oſſirdo</hi> took their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169974:125"/>the City of <hi>Feſſa,</hi> which gives name to the Region and Kingdome, and is the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of all <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arelida,</hi> utterly forgetting all thoſe ſorrows which would violently have obliged her to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, enjoyed the delights of that ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which is a Paradiſe to thoſe hearts that know how to enjoy it. She threw to the earth the Statue of revenge, raiſing in the place of it that of oblivion. It was an old woman crown'd with Mandrakes. With her right hand ſhe held a Lynx bound, and with her left a bow of Juniper. She trod upon a winged boy, who had his eies covered with Poppy. She changed afterwards thoſe black colours into others more cheerefull to the eye, and more agreeable to the life ſhe intended. She aboliſhed thoſe Pictures which excited reſentments of ſorrow, ſetting ſuch in their roome as would rejoyce the ſight, Hares, Bucks, Birds, and Fiſh rendred not there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed the heart or hand.</p>
               <p>One day returning from hunting, got ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing afar off from hers, ſhe eſpied a Knight, that ſighing with a continuall complaint expreſt ſigns of a very great Paſſion. He was all armed but his head, having taken off his Helmet to take aire, or to give leave to the wind to carry thoſe ſigns into her face whom he loved. He bore in his Shield for his Empreſſe ſome Roſes, with a Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which ſaid, Life and death from the Sun. She came upon him before he was aware, ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable was he become by his paſſions. He had not
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169974:125"/>ſo much as perceived her, if <hi>Arelida</hi> had not ſaid to him, Knight, it were fit you dreſt your ſelfe in my cloaths, ſince with ſuch Lamentations you pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell the weakneſs of women. Tears misbecome all, and eſpecially a Knight, who ſhould not know how to complaine. What can be lookt for from him, who, to defend himſelfe from ſorrow, can make uſe of no other Armes but thoſe which fall from the eyes, put in practice by every the weakeſt woman. The Knight bluſh'd at theſe words, but with a gracious behaviour anſwered her:</p>
               <p>Faire Lady, Lamentations are not prohibited to Lovers. Love exacts no other tribute but of teares, and with them cannot be ſatiated. There is not any ſtrength of mind that can make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt that force which overthrows the mind. Love is an oppreſſion of the heart, which receives no eaſe but from ſighs and complaints. Rather he that loves is without himſelfe, living in the Object beloved, whereupon it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that the eyes ſhould ſhed teares for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of ſuch a loſſe. I conclude (faire Lady) that he cannot love that cannot lament; and that the kindneſſe of the eyes is an Index of the facilitie of the heart.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe my ſelfe convinced by your reaſons, replied <hi>Arelida,</hi> and entreat your pardon for my boldneſſe in diſturbing you, and for reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you for a thing, of which I had never any feeling. I earneſtly beſeech you, for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my errour, to go to my houſe not farre
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169974:126"/>from hence, where I will endeavour to ſerve you as much (as jeſting) I have offended you. The Knight refuſed not the invitation, and the rather by reaſon night was ſtolne much upon them. Being asked by <hi>Arelida</hi> of the Amours that cauſed him to be ſo ſad; in this manner the Knight began to unfold them.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Hiſtory of the Stranger-Knight.</head>
               <p>I (Lady) in little leſſe than ſixe Luſtrums made love to many. My Genius and opportunitie have made me many times fall upon objects which were unworthy of affection. The firſt was worſe than baſe, my inclination being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able any longer to abide the provocations of ſenſe. The weakneſſe of my age, and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of my Superiours allowed me not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore occaſion and deſigne to employ my ſelfe more worthily. In this <hi>I</hi> continued but a while, being interrupted by one who with a ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure watched over the dotages of my heart.</p>
               <p>I paſſed to the ſecond, ſo much exceeding the former, as I found there beauty above her, who out of her own choice betrayed that faith ſhe owed to another. Some years I continued in this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both becauſe I could not enjoy her but by ſtealth, and becauſe expreſſing for me a great kindneſs, I conceited my ſelfe eternally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to love her; I was diverted by an accident of Fortune, which in amorous encounters diſcovered me to thoſe eyes, who could not
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169974:126"/>look upon me but with ſcorne from them, and danger to me. Her tongue and authoritie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their power, ſo that ſhe recovered his favour whom ſhe had deceived, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to betray him no more. This ſhe obſerved inviolably, whence turning ſenſuality into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I proceeded to new complacencies. I met with two ſo ſingular beauties, that I ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined them from heaven if their infidelitie had not diſcovered their Deceits to me. One, that had a breaſt more barbarous than her name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me at the beginning of my love, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting her beautie of the quality of the Sun, ſhe would communicate it to all. The other, whoſe name was <hi>Aura,</hi> was of a mind ſo covetous, that all the Treaſures of the world were not ſufficient to ſatiate the Abyſſe of her Appetites. In Gold only remained the Ciments of her faith. She knew no other Idoll, and adored no other Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; I took occaſion to part with them both in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſlike, being able neither to endure Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor mercinarineſſe in love.</p>
               <p>I was grievouſly fearefull to apply againe my mind to other Loves, not that my ſenſe was not aſſenting, but not to hazard my ſelfe under tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſo undeſerving objects. I exalted my mind upon greater ſubjects, and beſtowed my heart upon thoſe beauties, which not to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the world, I perſwaded my ſelfe were divine. And I ſhould never have thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of them, whileſt they themſelves made me account them Celeſtiall. In theſe purſuites I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169974:127"/>a whole Luſtrum with ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fooliſhneſſe as hopes are more doubtfull, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights more dangerous, paſſions more vehement, and the fruit for the moſt part falne before it be ripe. They were not ſuperiour to others, neither in loyaltie, nor goodneſſe, though they made profeſſion of them: peradventure worſe, but (Miſtriſſes in the Arts of diſſimulation) coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited thoſe qualities they had not. It is true that a prohibition renders the delight the greater, and that it is an inſtinct of our humane kind to deſire greatly thoſe things we are forbidden; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Conſolations are embittered ſo by direfull accidents, that the dangers and changes do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the delights which may be gathered from them. The examples of others directed me to get out of the way; whereupon I had the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be ſecure with dammage to thoſe that were endangered by it. The counſels of my friends (in a high manner) encouraged me to that reſolution which was ſcarce believed by thoſe that ſaw it. In this while I enjoyed many Miſtriſſes, imitating the cuſtome of the Dogs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to drinke and fly; more to vent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of nature, than by the ſetled content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my heart. Theſe violences of ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed over, I was ever penitent; the ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of pleaſures being a torment to that mind which loves that delight only by accident.</p>
               <p>I had taken up a reſolution to live free, all loves being looſe and equally engaged to coſt and danger, when a pure chance of Fortune made
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169974:127"/>me fall between the Arms of a Beauty, which in deſpight of time, who had wronged her with ſome years, had in her a— I know not what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to my Genius. With this for ſome days I proved all thoſe allurements, and all thoſe ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which are prodigally beſtowed by the moſt diſſolute, and the moſt free. She would move at my very ſignes, and encountred my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before I knew how to requeſt, or deſire them. She took that part of my Preſents which was of the leaſt value. Truely, in her I could not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing, but an ardent deſire to ſerve me, aloofe from all thoſe Intereſts which render the delights of Love to be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that theſe tricks won ſuch a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in my heart, that although I did not affect her, ſhe pleaſed me ſo, that I knew not where to pretend to more. One day by Fortune I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered how I was inveigled. Finally, I perceived ſhe was not better then others of the like profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but yet very much cunninger than others. That which Age had ſtole from her Face, ſhee added to her wit. Pride and Covetouſneſſe ſtrove for precedency in that minde, the moſt perfidious, the moſt diſſembling, the moſt baſe of the world. It was no difficulty for me to leave her, my eye abhorring her no leſſe then my heart.</p>
               <p>I believe I lived but few hours free, becauſe I gave way to my ſelfe to be overcome by oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, or rather becauſe 'tis the nature of a yong man not to live without love. By chance I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169974:128"/>ſpectator of a Beauty ſo deſerving, that it was an injurie to the judgement to imagine her ſubject to a parallel. I ſuddenly gave her up the dominion over my ſelfe; it being an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rather of ſtupidity then diſcretion not to love her. I had the Fortune to ſerve her to my Contentment, our practice not ſuſpected, but to thoſe that envied my Felicities Converſation, made the flame greater, which ſo much the more increaſed, as a ſuppreſt Fire burnes the violenter. For a great while I had not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to declare my ſelfe. Shee with ſo great a wiſedome concealed her Affections, that ſhe gave not me the opportunity to diſcover my love. If at any time in Diſcourſe I let a word fall to my purpoſe, ſhe either ſeemed not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, or returned me an Anſwer contrary to my meaning.</p>
               <p>Six times the Moon had made a Pompe of her Inconſtancies, when being growne impatient of my timerous ſecretneſſe, feigning an Affection equall to that I bore her, I asked her Advice: If it were better to diſcover ones flames to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris by Letters, word of mouth, or by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of others. Shee readily anſwered me, that the Deciſion of that queſtion depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conveniency of the Lover. If he could come to ſpeake to her (ſhee ſaid) at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it was not wiſedome to make uſe of the truſt of any in ſo jealous a matter. That the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of ſuch Loves as are not proſtitute, if they be baſe, may be corrupted by others, as they be
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169974:128"/>bribed by you. If they be of a Condition above ordinary, the danger is greater then the profit. Many from Meſſengers become Lovers, and of Subſtitutes Principals.</p>
               <p>That a Letter is a dangerous thing, ſubject to a thouſand Accidents, all uncertaine; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he that writes Love-Letters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours much more to expreſs himſelf eloquent then enamoured. They inſert in them Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles, ſometimes ſo far from truth and poſſibility, as the tongue durſt not be ſo impudent as ſpeake them without bluſhing. Contrariwiſe, who ſpeaks to his Miſtris himſelfe, acquires the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſecrecie, which is a moſt neceſſarie part of Love; being unwilling to truſt with any other then his own heart a buſineſs of ſuch conſequence. He ſhewes himſelfe bold alſo, which is the Index of a noble minde, whilſt feare ordinarily reigns in breaſts repleat with baſeneſſe. He acts his own Reaſons with the greater Power; Eloquence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failing that Tongue which pleads its owne Intereſts: He perſwades moſt lively, who uſeth ſuch meanes, that his Countenance accompanies his words, and whoſe teares and ſighes precede them. If a Lover with a bold Oratorie pleads the Reaſons of his Cauſe, he need not deſpaire of victorie: There being no mind that yeelds ſooner to Periwaſions then that of Women: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly treating of Love, and rendring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſie to believe that which they deſire, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deceived by their owne Opinion, which eſtabliſheth them (by a treacherous Conſultation
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169974:129"/>with a Looking-glaſs) in a ſtate of Deſert, worthy of the obſequiouſneſſe of all hearts.</p>
               <p>If one be enamoured, although a timerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect dares hardly proffer what one deſires, there is no minde but may be inveigled, no ooſome but may be enflamed. A Woman ſhewes a great merit in her ſelfe, if ſhe hath the valour to terrifie her ſervant. She is perſwaded ſhe hath ſome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Divinity, when ſhe perceives ſuch Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in thoſe that love her. One ought ſo be fearefull but of great things; And a Woman cannot deny love to thoſe, who loving her profeſs ſo great eſtimation of her. Other things alſo there are which cannot be expreſſed, nor brought to effect by Letters, nor by Meſsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe anſwered me. Whereupon I thus added; Then will I take your Counſell, which without doubt will lead my heart forth of thoſe errours, which thoſe encounter which take no adviſe but from themſelves. So I revealed my Affection: She remained without motion of my Propoſall, and all her colour flying from her face, ſhe neither denyed me, nor afforded me a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency: I would have added other new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, but being interrupted by thoſe that waited on her, I left my Enterprize imperfect. The day afterward I found her languiſhing in bed of a Maladie not inferiour to mine, for ſhee perceived her heart wounded with an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I attended on her, procuring her all thoſe Remedies, which by the ability of Phyſicians, or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169974:129"/>by the power of Art were imagined neceſſarie. In a ſhort time ſhee was freed from her ſickneſs, driven away (I know not whether) by my vowes or teares.</p>
               <p>But yet ſhe kept her bed, to invigorate, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially her minde. when I afreſh repreſented her with my love. She thanked me for it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged her ſelfe beholding, and promiſed mee all correſpondency, ſo they might not derogate from the Laws of her honeſtie. I anew redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my Entreaties and Supplications; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the day (according to the Cuſtome of the Countrey) when all gave Preſents, ſhea vouchſafed me a kiſſe. This ſo happy beginning gave me occaſion and heart to beſeech more, and raviſh more from her. It was an eaſie matter for me, for ſhe with expreſſions of Affection uſed to reach to me.</p>
               <p>I attended the accompliſhment of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, which are not extinguiſhed with a kiſſe, when Fortune would infelicitate me with happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes themſelves. I was choſen Commiſſarie to the Souldierie of the Caſtle of <hi>Lomapa</hi> by the Councell of State. My departure thence was with that reſentment, as if my ſoule were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from my body. A thouſand doubts combate upon the feare of my minde, having abandoned her who can only reconſolate the ſadneſses of my heart. My greateſt eaſe is to walke ſometimes, wandring up and downe theſe Fields, participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my paſſion with them. You will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hereafter have reaſon to chide me, having
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169974:130"/>underſtood the juſtice of my teares.</p>
               <p>I ſuffer with you (Sir Knight) replyed <hi>Arelida,</hi> and compaſſionate you; and ſo much the more, becauſe I have reaſon to doe ſo. And now being come neare the Pallace, they were met by the Squires, who having already covered the Tables, waited the returne of their Lady. <hi>Arelida</hi> and the Knight preſently ſate them downe. Where, after a ſupper of the moſt delicate meats, they proceeded into diverſe diſcourſes, untill being told by them that waited, that the night was very far ſpent, they retired to their reſts: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the griefe the Knight felt (for the great diſtance of his beloved Object) did not afford him, but one ſhort ſleep diſquieted by a thouſand Phantaſmes.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Dorcone,</hi> the King of the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> remained in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> honoured by King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> with an Affection above his Genius, by reaſon of his new Enmity with the Prince of <hi>Creet.</hi> The day was ſpent either in Tourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Huntings and a great part of the nights in Playes and Dances. At all times the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> would wait upon <hi>Dianea,</hi> who although ſhe was full of ſorrow for the remote abſence of <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> feigned her ſelfe to accept him grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though ſhe ſeriouſly hated him.</p>
               <p>He repleat with confidence, through the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> one day taking him aſide, requeſted the marriage with <hi>Dianea,</hi> demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that theſe Nuptials onely could ſecure the ſafety of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> inſidiated by the Kings of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:169974:130"/>of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> and of all thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied or feared the greatneſs of him: That the wiſedome of men conſiſted in preventing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But if theſe Motives ſhould even prove uſeleſs, he hoped to obtaine her, becauſe he could not beſtow his daughter on a dearer friend, and a ſonne more intereſted to his Majeſty. King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> thanking the <hi>Thracian</hi> for his excellent diſpoſition, through which he was willing to change Friendſhip into Alliance, replyed; That in a buſineſs of ſuch conſequence, he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Councell with it, to conclude the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, with the greater reputation to them both. That he had deſigned to beſtow <hi>Dianea</hi> on the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> to whom he had imparted ſome of his Reſolution with the Aſſent of the ſame Councell, that if it ſhould be in his power to retract his word, he would doe it more then willingly, there being no compariſon betweene the greatneſs of the <hi>Thracian,</hi> and the poore Fortunes of a Duke. That Princes nevertheleſs in ſome buſineſs were not Patrons of themſelves. Leaving him then in this Commotion of heart, hee demanded the Opinion of his Councell of State.</p>
               <p>Onely two raiſed Opinions. The Baron of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varta,</hi> a young man of great wit, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Favours from the <hi>Thracian,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for him: And the Count of <hi>Saline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the greateſt among the chiefe oppoſed him.</p>
               <p>The Baron ſaid, that the motions of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169974:131"/>had need of great ſtaies. That all forraign Princes were ill-affected, and all their Neighbors Enemies. If that <hi>Thracia</hi> ſhould not be intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the defence of the Kingdome, they had no other hope. That the modeſty of the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> would pretend no Reſentment to yield up that to a King, which had been promiſed to him. That he would aſſent to it, having not an Ambition after ſo great things, and the ſooner, becauſe that Promiſe had not exceeded the Kings deſire, and the Approbation of the Councel. That Accidents alter the Deliberations of Princes, who would not have a juriſdiction ſuperiour to others, if they might not alter at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. He concluded; it was but reaſon to give a Queen to <hi>Thracia,</hi> having ſlaine them a King.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Salinera</hi> on the other ſide, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Affections but thoſe of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Intereſt, ſpoke with more lively Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Then (ſaid he) ſhall the Kingdome of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> ſeek for Kings from <hi>Thracia.</hi> Then ſhall our Greatneſs be proſtituted to the command of Barbarians. I know not how ſuch conceits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not rejected before they be ſpoken. What Motives ſhould invite us! Perhaps the greatneſs of the King of <hi>Thracia.</hi> Hath then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> need of Greatneſſe. To joyne it to <hi>Thracia,</hi> is to deſtroy it, not to make it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Kingdome will be changed into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and we ſhall all be ſubjects to <hi>Thracia.</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:169974:131"/>The feare of our Enemies is not ſo much as to make us deliver our ſelves into the hands of our very Enemies. I much more feare the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> then the hatred of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Armenia, Creet,</hi> and all the World. Then ſhall a remote Feare without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundations then thoſe of Opinion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Counſell of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to ſubjection. Theſe ſame Kings which are aſſerted for Enemies would become united to defend us: The reaſon of State not permitting the Augmentation of another. His Majeſty ſhould lay to heart, if not his Word, at the leaſt his Intereſts. The Armes, and Armies are under the Dukes Command. To render him diſcontented, in my opinion were to provoke him to the prejudice of the State: He hath a heart that cannot beare an affront. He added other Reaſons, but nevertheleſſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter party gave Vote to that of the Baron of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varta,</hi> both becauſe they perceived the Kings minde enclined that way, and becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied at the Choiſe made of the Duke of <hi>Filena.</hi> So much Adulation and Envy can prevaile in Councellors.</p>
               <p>The Conſult ended; the King went to <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's</hi> Lodgings, and taking her by the hand, led her aſide; ſaying to her: You may ſee (through your owne underſtanding) our dangers and thoſe of the Kingdom. All Princes aym at my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and if I prevent not their Malignity with ſome Defence, I muſt onely waite to become a prey to the Ambition of thoſe who would raiſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169974:132"/>warre even againſt <hi>Jove.</hi> This cannot be done without joyning you in marriage to ſome great Prince, who intereſting himſelfe in our Affaires, will be of power to protect us.</p>
               <p>There could not have been a worthier Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then that of the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> while new Accidents had not preſented to us new Reſolutions. To alter an opinion is convenient to all, but particularly to Princes; who feare not cenſure, nor puniſhment for their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. The Intereſts of our ſecurity have made me change the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> into the King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> ſo much the more deſerving you, as you merit no leſſe Perſonage for your Husband then a King. You will evermore receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, following the Opinion of the Councell of State, and the command of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea</hi> ſuffered not theſe words without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: Yet ſhe was unwilling that any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſignes ſhould appeare to her Father, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to oppoſe her Diſcontents though very reaſonable. For a while ſhe deferred her Anſwer, as if ſhe premeditated words, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe ſhee was to declare an Opinion remote from that of her Father, ſhe was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to prolong as much as was poſſible her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring him. Laſtly, the Enſignes, I know not whether of Shame or Diſcontent, unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in her Countenance, ſhee thus anſwered him;</p>
               <p>Sir, in ſome things I ſuppoſed my ſelfe not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:169974:132"/>obliged to obey your Majeſtie, above once you commanded me that I ſhould reſpect the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> as my Husband, and (in deſpite of my heart) I aſſented, which perchance was very unwilling to ſubmit to Matrimonie. Now I would humble my ſelfe to your reſolutions if I could do it, or if it lay within my power to do it. I find my ſelfe engaged to the Duke of <hi>Filena,</hi> and am not in a condition to receive affections, nor to love another. Let the tenderneſſe of a Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate the weakneſſe of his Daughter, who with the loſing of my ſelfe have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to obey my Father. I do not call to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the infelicious remembrances of the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> infidelitie, becauſe this ought to be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of diſcretion which ſome ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to me. I have not an ambition for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Kingdomes. This of <hi>Cyprus</hi> is ſufficient to ſatiate the vaſtitie of theſe thoughts, which peradventure would not be wooed into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Dominion of a World. The valour of the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> allowes us not an oceaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to dread the hoſtilitie of enemies. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Negrepont</hi> ſpeakes too much otherwiſe of his virtue. I know not who would reſiſt a ſhip when he ſhould aſſiſt at the ſterne.</p>
               <p>She would have added other reaſons, but was interrupted by King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> who ſaid to her: <hi>Dianea,</hi> I am not come to diſpute with you, but only to acquaint you with my reſolvs. As a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you ſhould reverence them, as diſercet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them. The intereſts of the State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169974:133"/>appertaine not to your Age, nor to your Sexe. It concernes me to make you obey, and acknowledge the Obligation you owe to the Gods, and to a Father ſo affectionate, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea,</hi> perceiving him full of anger, threw her ſelfe at his feet, and there ſpeaking and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, united her teares and ſupplications to perſwade him, and overcome him at the ſame time. All was in vaine, for with a rigorous ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie he determined the Nuptials ſhould be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized without delay. Whereupon <hi>Dianea</hi> deſpaiting altogether of her life, would not any longer conceale her affections. Proſtrating her ſelfe againe at his feet, with ſobs, and ſighs, and all her cunning, ſhe ſaid to him:</p>
               <p>Father, Behold the unhappy <hi>Dianea</hi> compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led languiſhing at your feet to confeſſe the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and follies of her heart. I deny not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the moſt ſevere rigours of your indignation, not for any fault I can diſcerne in my Election, but for having made it without the approbation of your Majeſtie. But now torments and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are prepared, for I cannot aſſent to a new Marriage, having given my Faith to <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> Prince of <hi>Creete.</hi> Let not your Majeſty thinke that I will juſtifie the demerit of my diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for I will have no reaſon againſt a Father who hath been pleaſed to love me to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: Much leſſe can I beſeech you for pardon, becauſe my mind cannot imagine an offence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made choice of a Prince ſo great, and ſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169974:133"/>worthy; nor can I admit of repentance for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving elected him.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> in a moment changed colour a thouſand times. That countenance, which through age was nothing but paleneſſe, he apparelled with ſo many flames, that it well preclaimed the fire which he nouriſhed in his breaſt. He would have thruſt <hi>Dianea</hi> from him, who held him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his Knees, if a ſudden feare had not brought a trembling both into his feet and hands.</p>
               <p>Recovering in ſome meaſure his ſtrength, and growing into a fury, he gave command for the impriſonment of <hi>Dianea.</hi> There was not any that durſt contradict him, nor enquire of him the cauſe; ſhewing himſelfe ſo highly diſpleaſed, that it was not with ſecuritie of life to ſpeake to him. About an hour after, diſſembling the flames of his perturbation, he ſent for the <hi>Thracian,</hi> to whom he related his miſeries, with reſentments ſo lively, that <hi>Dorcone</hi> himſelfe was enforced to accompanie him in weeping. After wards, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſilence, he was compelled to by griefe, he began to ſay:</p>
               <p>O what prodigies are theſe that reward me with inventions of impoſſibilitie, only to render me miſerable. Father you have ſlaine me. How can it be, that <hi>Dianea,</hi> who beares baſhfulneſſe and ſimplicity in her countenance, ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to her Father? Can ſhe be immodeſt? Your Majeſty muſt excuſe me if I beleeve it not: For my affection would not receive an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169974:134"/>on of things which might prejudice the honour of <hi>Dianea.</hi> But yet let it be how it will; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Majeſty to beſtow her on me, becauſe my affection is not capable of any thing but the poſſeſſion of her. I hope by ſerving her I ſhall diſpoyle her of all thoſe loves which have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her engaged to another.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> ſetting aſide the intereſts of his Kingdome, anſwered: Friend, I am unwilling ſhe ſhould be anothers who would not be mine. She ſhall receive from me double puniſhment, as from a Judge, and as from a Father. Having abuſed the effects of my love ſhe ſhall prove thoſe of my indignation. The <hi>Thracian</hi> replied, ſuggeſting to him; That he could not more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſupply the Intereſts of her honour than by placing her in marriage; That otherwiſe ſhe would ever live with that blemiſh of ſhame on her Reputation. King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> becomming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient by the provocations of ſorrow, unable to ſuffer that others ſhould appoint him Rules to his Affaires, returned him a ſharpe anſwer: which <hi>Dorcone</hi> taking great exception at parted from him repleat with anger. The voices of the people encreaſed it upon him, who alwaies ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in their Furies, ſuppoſing him the author of <hi>Dianea's</hi> miſeries, followed him through the ſtreets with a thouſand reproaches. The <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> was become odious to all the Court, his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being diſcovered, appearing the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for a time he had diſſembled them. Many times he held himſelfe but little aſſured of his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:169974:134"/>life, perceiving the clamours multiplied in ſuch a manner, that they expreſt evidences of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorcone</hi> reſolved upon his departure, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to render himſelf lyable to the Precipices of the Vulgar, alwaies blind in their Judgements, and ever raſh in their Reſolutions. He ſcarce arrived at the Port, when he ſaw the burning of his two Galleys, conſumed with fire before the Marriners could provide any remedy. A few by ſwimming eſcaped the danger, the fire at one and the ſame time having deprived them both of preventions, and an eſcape. It was an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to penetrate into the originall, though the ſimpler ſort imagined it fire falne from heaven. This accident nevertheleſſe made him not at all retard his departure; for <hi>Dorcone,</hi> hiring a ſmall Veſſell, went aboord with all his.</p>
               <p>Before he was got far from the Port, he was certified of the death of <hi>Dianea.</hi> He with much ado ſuppreſſing his teares, began to vent a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand imprecations againſt that Father who had violated Nature, and thrown into oblivion the name and affection of a Father. Before he would haſten the Marriners to flye from that heaven, ſo impious, that it rendred a Father an Executioner to his own Children, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand better the particulars of <hi>Dianea's</hi> death.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Vafraro,</hi> who had a great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the Court, and who (to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) was left behind by <hi>Dorcone,</hi> thus gave him an account of it:</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:169974:135"/>
               <p>After the departure of your Majeſty, King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> convoked his privy Councell, whom he made acquainted with the Amours of <hi>Dianea,</hi> propoſing what puniſhment a Daughter deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that had diſobeyed her Father, defamed the Kingdome, and betrayed her honeſty. By the Councell there was two waies demonſtrated to him: The one of the Laws of the Kingdome, which appointed her to puniſhment, and that of the affection of his Majeſtie which might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her worthy of grace and pardon: Both juſt, though that of the Fathers forgiveneſs more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For if he pardoned through the effects of his clemency thoſe he did not love; why ought he not to pardon her whom he ſhould love more than himſelfe? Afterwards he was beſeeched by all the Councell to impoſe upon the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of youth that puniſhment which the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Princeſs merited. That a Father nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to be a King or Judge againſt his Children. That the old age of his Majeſtie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not ſuch an affliction; neither the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſuch a loſſe.</p>
               <p>To theſe reaſons King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> anſwered, that he could not diſtinguiſh between the perſon of a Father, and that of a King. That he had loved <hi>Dianea,</hi> accounting her a ſupport to his age, a reputation to his houſe, an honour to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and a benefit to his People. But ſhe proving otherwiſe, he was obliged to hate her. That, that ill which impunity might bring forth, or the diſſembling of his Daughters errours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169974:135"/>him to condemne her; elſe he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be held culpable of the miſeries his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency would produce That it was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Kingdome to have no Heires, than to have them unworthy. That he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize himſelfe more by puniſhing her, than by ſeeing her a mother of many Children. It being an higher reputation in a juſt Judge, to take away the lives of his Children, than to abide them culpable. This ſaid, he made the Sentence of her death to be ſigned, which ſhe had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Laws of the Kingdome, having diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed her Father, married a Stranger, and made an oblation of her ſelfe before the Nuptials were ſolemnized. With a ſtrange undauntedneſſe he ſubſcribed it, whence many judged him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, or that he was inſenſible of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the miſeries of his Daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea,</hi> when ſhe heard the certainty of her death, and that the revocation of it depended upon the cruelty of him who was inexorable, ſaid: Is it poſſible that an only Princeſſe ſhould not obtaine a jot of pity in a Father to give her the courteſie of her life? Not a jot of favour in the Councell to excuſe her? No whit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in her Friends to beare with her, who was reverenced a little while ſince as the Kingdomes Heire? Then by Picture were preſented to her many formes of death. She would not look on them; ſaying, That all deaths were equally cruell, and ſo much the more commanded from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She made a little aggravation upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169974:136"/>of her Fortune, on the inhumanity of her Father, and on the cruelty of the Councell. Although theſe words flowed forth from the Ardours of her mind, ſhe had nevertheleſſe ſo great a moderation in her ſorrow, that ſhe preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricated not into imprecations, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thoſe who looke upon death approaching. She deſired ſhe might be allowed to write to her Father, and it not being denied her, ſhe ſigned a Folio with theſe enſuing Characters.</p>

            <p>Theſe words were applauded by all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; whereupon the Fleet they re-inforced with ſuch a multitude of men, that they ſeemed now to have conquered two Worlds. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency was given to the Duke of <hi>Nicopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> a ſubject of ſo worthy conditions, that there was not any that envied him that honour. Many
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169974:139"/>Princes that were then in Court, enamoured on the Princeſſe <hi>Dercilinda,</hi> accompanied the Fleet with the greateſt poſſible ſtrength of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. There was the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> a young man whoſe ſtrength exceeded the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his yeares. The King of <hi>Scythia</hi> fooliſhly cruell, who was unacquainted with any other reaſons, but thoſe of the ſword. The Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> who, if he had had Valour equall to his Pride, had been without equals. He was acute in his diſcourſe, but alwaies Satyricall, and therefore odious even to his friends. The Prince of <hi>Epirus</hi> advanced into years, and repleat with Wiſedome; yet little skilfull in matters of love: And the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who vaunting himſelfe to be heir of <hi>Mars,</hi> omitted no occaſion to make him ſuppoſed ſuch.</p>
            <p>Of the Subjects of <hi>Thracia,</hi> among others, the moſt conſpicuous were foure Dukes, of <hi>Pereno,</hi> of <hi>Scitone,</hi> of <hi>Redcſto,</hi> and of <hi>Selimbria.</hi> Six Counts; of <hi>Finopolis,</hi> of <hi>Perontieo,</hi> of <hi>Tinia,</hi> of <hi>Patia,</hi> of <hi>Marcorico,</hi> and of <hi>Marcnia.</hi> Two Barons, that of <hi>Cardia,</hi> ſo repleat with Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Valour, that his Pen and his Sword rendred him equally glorious: And that of <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alo,</hi> perhaps richer then the King, but of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a behaviour, that (with good reaſon) he was abhorred by all.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Fleet proceeded towards <hi>Cyprus, Dorcone</hi> was carried by contrary windes into the Sea of <hi>Saturn,</hi> within a little diſtance of the Iſle of <hi>Melena.</hi> There ſtaying ſome time to mend
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169974:139"/>the dammages they had received by the late Tempeſt, he made the Veſſell to be directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Thracia;</hi> whilſt with an anxiety of Thoughte he accuſed Heaven, Windes, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny; that even flyingly they tranſported him not where his minde deſired to be; at the ſame time he took notice that the Mariners ſtrook ſaile; and throwing forth the Cock-boat, they did an obedience to a Gally. Full of indignation, he commanded the Captaine of the Veſſell into his preſence, of whom he demanded the cauſe of his delay, who if they even flew would not have been altogether ſatisfied with it.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Mariners Hiſtorie.</head>
               <p>HE was anſwered by the Mariner, that being on the Sea, belonging to the free Princes, he was obliged in duty to acknowledge their Dominion, which was not doubted of by any. Then applyed the <hi>Thracian,</hi> the Liberty of the Sea is alſo put into contention by tyrannical Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Can Navigation, which Nature hath rendred common to all, be uſurped by any? The Mariner anſwered; That the ſailing on the Sea was common to all: It remained not therefore, that the ſuperintendency belonged not to ſome. That Nature her ſelfe had produced all things for all: yet nevertheleſs the cuſtome of Nations made every one the Patron of their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: That it was neceſſary that ſome ſhould have the predominancy of the Sea to defend
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:169974:140"/>it from the Rapacity of Pirats.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thracian</hi> replyed, ſomewhat pacified in his fury; and why doth this Soveraignty of the Sea belong to the free Princes, and to no other Prince who hath his Kingdoms neare to the ſame Sea?</p>
               <p>It is no difficult buſineſſe, added the Mariner, to prove it: There being two foundations upon which the moſt juſt command of the free Princes over the Sea is raiſed. The one is, having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied it, as a thing altogether abandoned by the firſt, and legitimate poſſeſſors; The other is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving defended it through ſo many ages, againſt all the ſtrength of Armes, and envy of all their Enemies in the world. It is a thing without the juriſdiction of Doubt or Diſpute, that thoſe things which have no Patron, or becauſe they never had, or becauſe the lawfull Lord ſlighted the Poſſeſſion, belong to thoſe that firſt ſeize them, and defend them: and ſuch an one hath a juſt Title, and a Legitimate Command to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the true Owner. By the very ſame right the free Princes have made themſelves Maſters of the Lakes, in the which they founded their City, beleeved by all the Miracle of Nations, and a Modell of that of Heaven. For the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which were the moſt noble of the moſt noble Cities, retiting themſelves to avoid the cruelty of Barbarians, and finding them unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, and abandoned by the Owners, as a thing of ſmall moment, gave the beginning to the glorious Foundation of their City, not finding
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169974:140"/>any that had the boldneſs to oppoſe, they became Lords of the place, as of a thing that ought to be his, who came the firſt to poſſeſs it. VVhereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperours of the Eaſt, and VVeſt, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between them the Empire, declared; That the City of the free Princes ſhould remaine free, and that it ſhould be underſtood to belong to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them.</p>
               <p>The very ſame juſt Title then that the free Princes have of their City, they have alſo over this Sea. This Sea of <hi>Saturne,</hi> which is enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Iſtria, Albania, Pulia,</hi> and <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and <hi>Romania,</hi> did formerly appertaine to the Emperour of the Eaſt. The viciſſitude of things which never ſuffers greatneſſes to continue in their heights, debilitated in ſuch wiſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Maritimate Forces, that being unable to defend this Sea, he left it expoſed to the Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all thoſe which would infeſt it. The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> a people accuſtomed to Thefts and Rapines, becomming potent by moleſting it dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, impoſed a tribute upon the Navigation, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Patrons. The Emperour never ſuppreſt ſo great a preſumption, although the teares of his Subjects, who were robbed by theſe Pirats, acquainted him with the Loſſes they received by it.</p>
               <p>The free Princes perceiving the Emperour had abandoned and neglected the poſſeſſion of this Sea, leauing it in prey to Pirats, who arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to themſelves the Dominion of it, and made themſelves Lords of it, took Armes, and by the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169974:141"/>ſpace of an hundred and ſeventy yeares, fought continually againſt the <hi>Narentines.</hi> Theſe made ſuch a reſiſtance, favoured and ſuccoured by the King of <hi>Croatia,</hi> that in the end they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and conſtrained to ſue for peace. The free Princes gave it them, but with a condition, that leaving their Piracies, they ſhould never more demand any Tribute for Navigation: And ſo they became Lords of this Sea, the Emperours of the Eaſt themſelves aſſenting to it, although Malignity, Envy, or Force ſhould deprive them of it. In the maintaining of which, the Gold and Bloud which they have ſpent, would buy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh a world.</p>
               <p>I could ſay, that the preſcription of time, which is of many entire ages, admits not of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to doubt a verity rendred ſo indubitable by yeares. I could ſay, that a thouſand, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hiſtorians, not obliged to their Intereſt, but to the duty of truth, affirm this lawfull poſseſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that for above three hundred years, without ever being contradicted, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Tribute for Navigation. I could adde, that the greateſt Princes of the world are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſses to this, who confirming this moſt juſt poſseſſion, have upon many occaſions by publick writing confeſsed this truth. Neither have they ever had the boldneſs to paſse with their Fleets before they have got leave, which hath many times been denyed them, and many times gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to their Intereſts. I could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne many other Reaſons that vindicate this
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169974:141"/>verity above ſuſpicion: but ſpeaking to a Prince that underſtands all things, I have peradventure treſpaſsed too farre in ſaying ſo much.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that I cannot conceale (with pardon from your benignity) an annuall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, no leſs great then ancient, which theſe Princes uſe in ſigne of Soveraignty ever the Sea. One day of the moſt ſolemne in the yeare, the Duke and Senate of the free Princes, with the Ambaſsadours of the greateſt Kings with that State which is agreeable to their greatneſs go to eſpouſe the Sea; the Prince throwing in a rich Ring, ſaying; We wed thee (O Sea) in ſigne of a true and perpetuall Command. Can your Majeſty deſire more true, or Reaſons more ſatisfactory? VVonder not then, if I (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming my ſelfe to Cuſtome, and ſo good cauſe for it) have done the Obedience that was due.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thracian</hi> ſeemed to be ſatisfied, ſaying; Theſe Reaſons beare a great ſtrength: but how come ſo great Intereſts knowne to you, accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely to plow the waves, and know the windes? how grew you acquainted with the Juriſdictions of theſe people? Your Majeſtie may pleaſe to know (the Mariner anſwered) that I am not ſuch as my Habit and Profeſſion ſhew. I am not a Mariner, but through pure neceſſity, Fortune that blindfoldly diſpenſes her Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, hath made me rather truſt to the Infidelity of a Sea then that of a Prince.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:169974:142"/>
               <p>I was borne in <hi>Catalonia</hi> the onely ſonne of a Duke, who for his vertues might have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the greateſt matters, although hee had not an Ambition to deſire them. My King knowing me an emulator of my Fathers example; ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted he ſhould neither keep his Life nor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if I ſhould have Children, or ſhould come into a way to have any: I was compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt my Genius, and to put on an habit different from my heart. This did not ſatisfie to ſecure the feares of my King, who perhaps was ſuſpicious of puniſhment for his owne violences. Comforted with hope, I undertook a voluntarie Exile. I went into the Kingdome of Fortune, and even into that City which is accuſtomed to allure every one by the Name of Love, although in the effects it returns death.</p>
               <p>There I had the occaſion to deteſt Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition, that triumph in that Court. Adulation is there in an exceſs, every one endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to advance himſelf in ſome Degree of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with his Patron, for his owne advantage. The pillage and ſale of Places, ſacred to the gods, is not reputed a Crime, becauſe it is practiſed by the greateſt. Cruelty there keeps reſidency, they not knowing Love, who know nothing but to deſtroy Nature. Gold becomes a recompence to the moſt vile, and the moſt ignoble. Holineſs, Innocency, and goodneſſe profeſſed in words, but by deeds altogether trodden under foot. All there is vendible, and many there ſell themſelves at the low price of a Mercenary hope, ſo much
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169974:142"/>the more uncertaine, in that it depends on a life for the moſt part conſumed of Phyſick and Years. The Kings there are Elective, whereupon they attempt all meanes to enrich themſelves, though to the prejudice of the Kingdome, and their Subjects. Rewards and Puniſhments are be-beſtowed at randome. Bribes overcome all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties: nor is there a greater Deſert then that of Riches. Juſtice in that Kingdome hath eyes and hands. There is no Religion but in habite, and that for the moſt part ſo laſcivious, that it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals thoſe of the moſt publick Courtezans. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which uſually in that Kingdome attained to the Crowne, is reduced into ſuch a Contempt, that either it is not known, or if known, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Hypocriſie poſſeſſeth a great part of thoſe that deſire to deceive the people. They endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the ſuppreſſion of truth, and there prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite Pens and Penſils. They forbid to others thoſe things which they would enjoy alone, and with the greateſt ſeverity puniſh thoſe faults which they themſelves are guilty of. In briefe, the moſt execrable Crimes, and the moſt deteſtable by the Laws of Nature, and the World, are in this Court become naturalized.</p>
               <p>Upon good Reaſon I can affirme ſo much, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to my owne perill had tryall of them all. To pleaſe the inſatiability of thoſe, who deprived me of mine owne, promiſing me what belonged to others; in a ſhort time, I found my ſelfe made a ſcorne to the Covetouſneſſe of thoſe impious ones, who ſo extreamly hate Poverty, that they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169974:143"/>cannot as much as endure it in others. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to depart thence, food failing me to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain life withall: The promiſes of my King vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, together with that allowance which he owed me upon all Obligations. But there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is prevalent with the powerful. I retired into the Iſland of <hi>Roſes,</hi> where betaking my ſelf to Navigation, altogether clearing my minde of thoſe hopes which were able to diſquiet me, I paſſe away my years in felicity.</p>
               <p>They were in this while advanced a great way in their voiage, and entred into the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> when they diſcovered a Fleet, which made them put a period to their Diſcourſes. They that ſtood Sentinell, gave notice that they diſoovered a number of Sailes ſo great, that a greater had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſeen upon thoſe Seas, and that by their Streamers they appeared to be of <hi>Thracia. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone</hi> troubled at this Newes, proceeded on in ſuch an anxiety, that he knew nor what to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: but this change continued not loog; For two Galleyes putting forth to know the Veſſell, and hardly underſtanding their King was aboard it; but ſigne being given of it to the Navy, there was not any demonſtration of joy omitted. The Duke of <hi>Nicopol is,</hi> with all the other Knights came to receive him; whereupon entring upon the Admirall, he enquired the cauſe of their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. When he underſtood it, he began to thank the Gods that had exceeded him in his deſires. He acquainted them with his Thoughts, and ſo without any delay they went on towards the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169974:143"/>Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> They ſailed ſixe daies, and there wanted not two houres of determining the night of the ſeventh when the Fleet entred into the Port of <hi>Cromia,</hi> diſtant from the City of <hi>Cury</hi> halfe a League, ſcituated on the top of the Cape towards the Weſt. Although the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were prepared for battell they found no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment that might prohibit their Landing.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſsileo</hi> being aſcertained of this evill that was neare him by the preparations of ſo powerfull an enemy, his ſorrowes for the death of <hi>Draned,</hi> being for the moſt part paſt over, (a new hurt frequently occaſioning the forgetting of the paine of others) betook himſelfe to the defence of his Kingdome. He confirmed <hi>Viral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> in the Generalls place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he urged to it by <hi>Floridea</hi> had attempted all meanes poſſible to be diſpenſed with. The King would have the opinion of his Councell about the ſtate of this War, ſo much the crueller by how much the unjuſter. There were divers opinions, and many not without Intereſts. Thoſe that had poſſeſſions, the neareſt to the enemies violence, eagerly maintained that they ought to impedite his Landing. Theſe were their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p>That it was not fitting at the beginning of a War to ſhew any ſigne of feare, ſhutting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up within Walls, erected only for the weakneſſe of thoſe minds that dare not make a wall of their own breaſts againſt the courage of their enemies. That keeping the <hi>Thracians</hi> by
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169974:144"/>ſtrength ſome daies at ſea, they might be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuffer thoſe diſcommodities that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture might have the power to perſwade them into new deliberations. That they ought not to abandon without bloud a thing ſo deare to them as the Port: neither was it reaſonable to loſe it without danger. Perhaps the <hi>Thracians</hi> having experimented our Force will repent them of the Enterpriſe. There is not any thing that alters minds more than perill. To concede ones owne to an enemy without blowes is to encreaſe his pride by the cowardice of our own Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. That the <hi>Thracian,</hi> being kept aloofe at Sea, will ſuffer the incommodities of hunger, which being permitted to Land he will make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Theſe reaſons, though they were lively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by thoſe to whom their own intereſts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the more carneſtneſſe, did not attaine, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, the Baron of <hi>Acamara</hi> ſpeaking to the contrary with his utmoſt eloquence.</p>
               <p>It is a raſhneſſe (he ſaid) to contend againſt impoſſibility; we muſt leave the Port free to our enemies, becauſe we have not Forces to defend it. The reaſons alleadged were probable, if the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> had but one only Port: But having ſo many, which of them ſhall we defend? The <hi>Thracian</hi> Fleet is ſo numerous, that they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded can aſſaile us in divers parts. On the other ſide, we have not ſo many men that we can part them. In my opinion, it will be the ſureſt way to preſerve our Souldiery in the principall Cities untill wiſdome or fortune ſhall afford us
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169974:144"/>an occaſion to attempt greater matters. If by Armes we ſhould oppoſe their landing, we ſhould have our enemies in our face. Leaving them the Port and the Field, fighting them they will be alwaies divided. The Souldiers will the rather ſtick to our defence, ſeeing that we would not have our ſecurity by their danger. The Cities are well ſtored with proviſions for life, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for war: Is it poſſible then in the meane while that our miſeries ſhould not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pity of thoſe who feare the greatneſſe and the ambition of the <hi>Thracian.</hi> I beleeve the Embaſſage deſtined to the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> will not prove fruitleſſe. The King of <hi>Arabia</hi> would not ſee our oppreſſion. <hi>Mauritania</hi> and <hi>Gorſica</hi> doubtleſſe willſtir in our defence. In the meane while, to keep our Forces entire is the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure way: It will alwaies be time enough to hazard them. Valour conſiſts in fighting, not in precipitating. Let us let our enemies land, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an act of prudence to leave that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be held without perill. This is my opinion, who have no Intereſt greater than that of the publike ſafety. Notwithſtanding I alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſelfe to an obedience of what your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall command.</p>
               <p>There was not any that had the confidence to oppoſe thoſe reaſons: Whereupon the <hi>Thracians</hi> came to land without hinderance. But they would not remove from the Port untill they received information from their Spies. Being certified of King <hi>Vaſsileos</hi> Reſolutions, they plundered a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169974:145"/>great part of the Iſſe with ſmall profit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the people and all things of value being got into the principall Cities. They put it into a diſpute whether they ſhould firſt attempt the Conqueſt of the other Cities, or of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, which was <hi>Arſinoe.</hi> Many delivered their opinions, and amongſt others the Duke of <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> maintained they ſhould firſt take the other Cities before they laid ſiege to <hi>Arſinoe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conqueſts (ſaid he) and victories conſiſt in the reputation of Armies: And how can this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation be acquired continuing at the ſiege of a City rendred inexpugnable by the ſtrength of the ſcituation, and the obſtinacy of the Defenders? I for my own inſtruction have ſtudied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and I thinke it inſuperable if you have no ſecret intelligence, which if you have I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. It is built upon a naturall Rock, and not liable therefore to be mined. The walls are all of fine ſtone, and ſo broad that two carts may meet. On the top they are made after the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Scarpe, and within there is ſo much roome that it can containe an infinite number of people. Within it is fortified by an high Cavag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere, and three Baſtions of earth. It hath a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke in the wall furniſhed with warlike inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that both from above and below ſcoure the ditch from one ſide to the other. It is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by great Towers which encompaſſe it, and within hath a large ſtreet following the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the wals for the conveniency of the horſe. The Ditches are deep, induſtriouſly made
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169974:145"/>by the force of Chizels. The Flankers of the Ditch are as high, or higher than the top of the walls. The earth without is made like a Scarpe, ſo that the houſes of the City cannot be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in aſſaults can receive no harme. There is alſo the Caſtle trenched about with ditches, into which the Sea comes, in ſuch wiſe ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I figure to my ſelfe the winning of it an impoſſibility. Contratiwiſe, ſetting upon others leſſe ſtrong, and weaklier defended, our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers will receive a recompence for their labours more commodiouſly, and with leſſe danger. All the chief ſtrength of King <hi>Vaſsileo</hi> is within <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe;</hi> there he attends us, there he wiſhes for us. He will conſume us before he can be overcome. It is provided with victuals a long time, and fears not ſtorming. For my full diſcharge I muſt add, that to beſiege it is to endanger the Army, the aire being unwholſome, and the waters corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whileſt they within the City on the other ſide have moſt pure in their wells. All the Iſland being ſurprized, what will King <hi>Vaſsileo</hi> do with the only place of <hi>Arſinoe?</hi> Afterwards we may with leſſe inconveniency beſiege him, having no Foe at our backs. I beſeech your Majeſty to excuſe me, if peradventure I have not encountred the beſt, and your meaning.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> all the other remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſilent, thus anſwered him: If all the Cities of the Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> would fall into our hands with that facility that your opinion figures to you, I ſhould likewiſe ſubſcribe that <hi>Arſinoe</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:169974:146"/>ſhould be the laſt that ſhould prove our Forces. But all the Cities being very ſtrong, I muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme there can be no ſecurer counſell given, than in the firſt place to beare our Armes to the Siege of <hi>Arſinoe.</hi> It will be a great terrour to King <hi>Vaſsileo,</hi> and all his Kingdome, to ſee us reſolved upon the moſt difficult enterpriſe; without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and the King, what will the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> availe us? When theſe are fala into our hands, who can ſupply his Office? Who will refuſe to obey us? Rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ordinarily fomentations to the greateſt reſiſtances. The King being taken, who will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life without hope of reward! And who will prove faithfull, not fearing the puniſhment of infidelity? But let us paſſe to a point of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſequence. We ought, without doubt, to beleeve that King <hi>Vaſsileo</hi> will be aided, either by thoſe that love him, or by thoſe that feare us. To perſwade our ſelves otherwiſe, is to give credit to the apparency of dreames, and to flatter our own deſires in an impoſſible ſuppoſition. Their Embaſſage deſigned for <hi>Egypt</hi> is now known, and the jealouſies of other Princes, who feare our greatneſſe. Succours then comming in time, before <hi>Arſinoe</hi> be tooke, or King <hi>Vaſsileo</hi> ſlaine, all our endeavours will prove in vaine, and our Armies fruitleſſe. Then we ſhall be neceſſitated to adventure a battell with an incertainty to which ſide victory will encline. The taken City ſeeing aide come will be againſt us, partly for hating to be under our command, and partly to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169974:146"/>deſerve ſome reward from their King. Having betrayed, and renounced their friends, with the greater facility they will deceive their enemies. It is not a ſecure reſolution to confide in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, whileſt any hope of their former Liberty remaines in them. They will rather be an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to us; for being to go to field, we muſt diſmember our Forces to guard them with a good number of Souldiery, not to afford them an opportunity of rebellion. <hi>Arſinoe</hi> won, all is won, and the Kingdome ſubjugated. The head is that which enlivens the members, and gives motion and ſtrength to all the reſt of the body. That the place is inexpugnable I know not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, although I acknowledge it very ſtrong. As light is communicable to all eyes, ſo there is not any place that ſubmits not to a valour above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. All that which is ſubject to neceſſity, and to the command of the elements, may alſo be brought under the Laws and ſtrength of a Conquerour. A Sword can make way through all; neither is there any thing but perſeverance, and experience may overcome it. So much the greater will the glory and the reputation of the <hi>Thracian</hi> Armies be, which attempt not upon enterprizes imagined poſſible. Facile attempts are thought unworthy of the <hi>Thracians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion prevailed, whereupon all the Army began to preſſe upon <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> they having tooke order that their Galleys ſhould block up the mouth of the haven. <hi>Viralto,</hi> who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to adventure upon ſo unequall a battell,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:169974:147"/>kept within the Wals, iſſuing forth onely under the advantages of night. The firſt time he did great harme to the <hi>Thraeians,</hi> with the ſlaughter alſo of many of their Officers: But once falling into an Ambuſcado, he was in danger of being ſlaine, loſing a great part of his men. Therefore he adventured but ſeldome forth; and onely to impedite their Machines, which the enemy built, carrying fire to them, but ever with very much danger.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> perceiving that a part of the Army was ſufficient for the begirting of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> whilſt they within poſſeſſed with feare ſtole out to runne away, and not to fight, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled <hi>Dorcone</hi> to attempt ſome ſurprizall. The <hi>Thracian</hi> approving of the Counſell, with ten thouſand men marched to <hi>Ceraunia,</hi> ſending the Count of <hi>Maronia</hi> with as many more to ſurprize <hi>Carpaſſia.</hi> This fell ſpeedily into the Earles hands; for comming upon it by night, and the Guard being deceived, he was brought into it without Reſiſtance. They ſaw themſelves ſeized upon before they knew the <hi>Thracians.</hi> Some that had time to lay hold on their Armes, there miſerably loſt their lives. The Count ſtaid not there, for leaving a good Garriſon in it, he advanced to the taking in of ſome Townes, in the which he found no oppoſition of any moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clides</hi> was a very ſtrong Caſtle, which with a few Souldiers could withſtand any violence. A Knight of good birth commanded there in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169974:147"/>Chiefe; but ſo unskilfull in Martiall affaires, that he had ſcarce the courage to look on the enemies Colours, and ſo baſely fled thence, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſhame to his Nation, and a diſgrace to thoſe who had advanced him to that Degree. So the Count took that place, and remained Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all the Champaine towards that part of the Iſland. On the other ſide, <hi>Dorcone,</hi> going to force <hi>Ceraunia,</hi> had the Fortune to ſeize upon a a Gate unexpectedly; but was ſuddenly repulſed by the Guard he found there. The Baron of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comia</hi> was Governour, a ſubject for every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion regardable, but admirable for his Loyalty. He defended the place with ſo much Valour, that he gave not occaſion to the <hi>Thracians</hi> hope to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thence with Victorie: Although a ſuddain fire had conſumed his Proviſions of Meat, and his Ammunition for warre, he was not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, reſolving rather to dye then to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Generoſity of his owne heart. The <hi>Thracian,</hi> who deſired to carry this place, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Baron by thoſe meanes that ordinarily uſe to overcome any poſſibility. The King made a Letter his Subject to overcome that minde, that ſo well knew how to defend himſelf from his Sword.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Thracian</hi> diſdaining to ſee the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thoſe that were combated by neceſſitie, gave command they ſhould be ſtormed at two places in one time, Thoſe within with ſuch an undauntedneſſe defended themſelves, that very many times they made them repent, whoſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages had tranſported them ſo far. The Governor willing to lay hold on any advantage, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Captaine to iſſue forth with a Troop of Horſe, and to charge the Enemy on the left ſide, whilſt another ſhould doe ſo on the right. The <hi>Thracians</hi> intent onely on their Aſſault might receive a notable loſſe.</p>
               <p>The Captaine refuſed to goe, ſaying; That he loved not his men ſo little to endanger them to Death. That it was raſhneſſe, not valour, to fight without hope of victorie. That to open the Gates could not be without perill, at the ſame time Conquerours, and the vanquiſhed having opportunity to enter into the City. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour angry at ſuch a Reply, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was in the hearing of all the Officers, and beleeving without doubt that he was gained by the Treacheries of the <hi>Thracian,</hi> unwilling that ſuch a Liberty ſhould paſſe into an example, drew his ſword, and many times calling him Traytor, and enemy to his King, with two thruſts killed him, running him thorough the breaſt. This was carried to two of the dead mans brothers, who with no ordinary valour were repulſing the violence of the enemy. Not ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure of their lives, and making more
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:169974:149"/>account of Revenge then honour, they left their ſtandings, and making many others adhering to them and friends to do the like; they ſaid, What reward can ariſe to be from Victorie, ſince our owne party is crueller then the enemies? What Palmes can glory promiſe us in a triumph ſoiled with our bloud? Are not the <hi>Thracians</hi> ſufficient to kill us, but we muſt feel the ſword of our friends? This is the fruit of our hopes. This is the end of our victories. Are ſouldiers ſo recompenced? Doe they ſo Crown Conquerours with the death of their Brothers, with the ſlaughter of their friends, and the deſtruction of the moſt valiant? The Foe ſurely would not have beene ſo cruell.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thracians</hi> were aware that on that part the Wall was without Defence; but they were unwilling to be too ſuddenly confident, ſuſpecting Treacherie. Laſtly, the boldeſt among them leading the way, they made it eaſie to others to climbe after them; whereupon a great number being got up, they ſet open a Gate, with the death of thoſe that made reſiſtance. The Governour ran thither, but it was too late, the enemy being encreaſed, and he in ſuch manner being abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his owne Party, that he had not ſo much time as to retreat into the Caſtle. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, his defending himſelfe with a great deale of Courage, he was ſet upon by ſuch a multitude of Souldiers, that after he had received many wounds, he fell downe dying, whilſt the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> poſſeſſed the whole City.</p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:169974:150"/>
               <p>They fell to the ſack of it, with ſuch a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Inhabitants and Souldiers, that there was not a perſon of any condition, who was not a partaker of the miſchiefe. The Covetouſneſſe of the Conquerors being ſatiated with the Riches of that City, which were ineſtimable, they gave themſelves over to luxury, not ſparing the moſt noble Maids, or the moſt chaſte Women. The night came upon them, which found them drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſleep and wine, without either Guards or Sentinels. They that fled from <hi>Clides,</hi> aſſembling together all thoſe others which forſook the Townes to retire into <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> underſtood the taking in of <hi>Ceraunia.</hi> The Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa,</hi> that led thoſe ſouldiers, imagining with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that Victory had rendred them without Guards, and Defence, reſolved to aſſault them.</p>
               <p>It was a little after midnight, when he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſurprize a Gate. It ſucceeded happily to him, finding onely the ſhouldiers, who rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to be ſlaine, then ſhew any ſigns of fighting. They were in ſuch manner ſpread over the City, that the noiſe was not obſerved, every one ſuppoſing thoſe voices were of their owne ſouldiers. If alſo any loud groane pierced the eares of the Captaines, it was believed of the miſerable inhabitants. It was already day, when laſtly, approaching death made them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the dammage they had received. The King would have made head, but finding himſelf onely with ten or fifteen of his Guard, he thought it wiſdome to withdraw from danger. He caſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169974:150"/>away the Royall Enſignes that they might not witneſſe who he was. The confuſion of ſouldiers wearied with ſo much ſlaughter, exempted him from impriſonment, and ſecured his flight, the greateſt part of his notwithſtanding being took Priſoners.</p>
               <p>He was got a League from <hi>Ceraunia,</hi> when he diſcovered a Troop of Horſe which came againſt him. He accounted himſelfe dead. He began to cry out, he was the King, that they ſhould not hurt him. Theſe, throwing themſelves from their Horſes, ran to reverence him, revealing themſelves for the Brothers of that Captaine, ſlaine by the Baron of <hi>Nicomia.</hi> They ſaid they were come to change Fortune, not willing to live any longer under his Command, who had ſo cruell Miniſters; That if he would pleaſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their ſervice, he ſhould finde them as faithfull, as where they had given a triall, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning the defences of the Wall. The <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> received them with affection, offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Companion to revenge the injuſt death of their brother.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at the Campe under <hi>Arſinoe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Fugitives, they brought a great terrour into the mindes of the Souldiers. And although this loſſe was inſenſible to the greatneſſe of ſuch an Army, nevertheleſs, Valour conſiſting more in the heart then in the number; many figured to themſelves dangers remote, not onely from ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but ſenſe. If the newes of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Count of <hi>Moronia</hi> had not reconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:169974:151"/>and envigorated the Army, without doubt this enterpriſe had falne to nothing. When they ſaw thoſe Souldiers ſo loaden with ſpoiles, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying their felicity, with a great deale of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they longed for an occaſion to fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viralto</hi> gave them one; for being advertiſed of all their ſucceſses he conſulted, with K. <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> to tempt Fortune a little under the auſpiciouſneſs of the night. By redoubled Meſsengers he gave the Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa</hi> to underſtand, that with the greateſt ſtrength poſſible he ſhould march off to the enemy, juſt at that time when he thought him the moſt engaged in ſleep. That giving a ſigne by fire of it, and finding himſelfe anſwered, he ſhould fall on them with all violence, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Pillage to every body, and taking of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>The Count, having received this Command, put himſelfe into order, without communicating his thought to any whatſoever. Being drawne neare to the Enemies Campe, the night being already farre ſpent, and the ſigne given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he divided his men into two Bodies, to bring the greater confuſion, and the greater feare. There were two waies which led to the <hi>Thracians</hi> Quarters. The one the ordinary, known to all, through the Champaine: the other full of Buſhes and Stones, a little about by the Shore. By this he would march, commanding the Baron of <hi>Lapithi,</hi> a Knight of great Fame, though poore in eſtate, to advance through the other.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:169974:151"/>
               <p>Theſe two Diviſions (amounted to above three thouſand Combatants, and although une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in number, yet not inferiour in hope) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the advantage to aſſaile an Army, which they beleeved repoſed ſecure under the ſhadow of the night. They ſilently marched on, nor broke ſilence untill they were come up to the firſt Guards. Then thundring forth an infinite of ſhouts, that would have incited feare in the breaſt of undauntedneſſe it ſelfe; A ſound of ſuch warlike inſtruments accompanied thoſe cries that animating all to victory rendred the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers more feareleſſe againſt the enemy. Feare and death opening a gap among the <hi>Thracians,</hi> made them give way to the Corps de Guard, who with their flight filled all the Tents with confuſion and noiſe. The neareſt, becomming bold by neceſſity, ran to Armes, but ſleepy, and full of wine, no knowing either Command, or obedience, fell upon themſelves, treading upon, and ſtriking one another.</p>
               <p>They ſaid, repleat with feare, where are thoſe that aſſaile us? Who hath the boldneſſe to diſturbe ſo powerfull an Hoſt? Are they enemies, or traitours that provoke us to Armes? Many in this while thought upon flight, which was no leſſe dangerous than fighting. Though the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets called the Souldiers to their Colours, though the Captaines endeavoured to reduce them into their Rankes, it ſucceeded but ſlowly, and with diſorder, the darkneſſe concealing the bluſhes of the Cowardice of the moſt vile. At the ſelfe
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169974:152"/>ſame time the news of this ill, and the ſhouts of the Souldiers arrived at the cares of the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> He preſently armed himſelfe, commanding the Duke of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> that he ſhould make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance on that part, whileſt he turned himſelfe to the other.</p>
               <p>To ſee their King ſo expoſed to dangers was the occaſion that all haſtened to the fight, not ſo much to overcome the enemy, as to defend the King, and to merit by the atteſtations of their valour. The Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa</hi> having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Trenches, and won ſome of the Forts ſtrove to ſet them on fire. But the <hi>Thracian</hi> comming upon him with the greateſt ſtrength of his Army, ſaw the mighty ſlaughter of his. The Souldiers were already drawn back to the breach, when in the meane while <hi>Viralto</hi> marching out of <hi>Arſinoe</hi> fell upon the <hi>Thracians,</hi> meaning to come on their backs. He aſſaulted them with mighty outcries to encreaſe the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the battell, and the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viralto</hi> ſaid to the Souldiers: On valiant Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and triumph over thoſe, who, almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſleep and feare, have no reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your valour. Let us ſacrifice to Revenge, by the benefit of the night, theſe cruell men, who cauſeleſly hate us. Regard not their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is neither defence, not ſecurity to them, but addes to their confuſion. Being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly in croudes, the darkneſſe will make them kill one another inſtead of us. If with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſolution you do not ſtrive for the victory,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169974:152"/>which Fortune offers you, there will be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no more hope neither for liberty, nor for life, nor honour.</p>
               <p>This threefold aſſault in this manner daunted the courages of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> that with a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they were made to move by their Officers. The Count of <hi>Macronia,</hi> with all the ſtrength he could gather, turned himſelfe to that part of the danger, and conſtrained <hi>Viralto</hi> to retire with all thoſe that followed him. Whereupon theſe, not a jot retarded by the hurt of wounds, by the loſſe of their Companions, or by the feare of death, would paſſe the Bridges or dye. Now they grappled with thoſe that reſiſted them, and now with an obſtinate reſolution, making a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of dead bodies, they attempted to clime upon their Rampiers; Darts and Arrows, though ſent at randome, yet fell not in vaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viralto,</hi> willing to ſhew proofe of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, forced the Trenches in deſpite of all thoſe that oppoſed him. He could dot be followed but by a few, the Princes of <hi>Miſſia</hi> and <hi>Epirus</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on with ſuch a number of Sonldiers, that the Duke was enforced to render himſelfe priſoner, whileſt all thoſe were ſlaine that accompanied him. On the other ſide, <hi>Dorcone</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> rendred vaine the Forces of the Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The night to both the Armies encreaſed the ſlaughter exceedingly, for not perceiving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or dangers, every one encountred
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:169974:153"/>death without fearing it. The Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa</hi> not able any longer to abide the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the <hi>Thracians</hi> ſet fire to their Tents, making alſo the ſame to be done to many of his. The <hi>Thracians,</hi> on the other ſide, making the wood-worke to be caſt to the ground, prevented the fire from encreaſing: Yet the ſmoke adding to the darkneſſe of the night occaſioned more horrour to the Souldiers, and the Conflict to be more cruell. Many falne and dying with a new manner of anger attempted revenge upon Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes. Others loſing their ſwords made uſe of their nailes and teeth, with ſo much ſavageneſſe, that they appeared rather beaſts than men.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> not able any longer to abide that the victory ſhould hang doubtfull, the Sun being now riſen, leaving his command of the Souldiers to the King of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> finding that multitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not but to diſorder them in thoſe narrow paſſages, led a great Party out thence, and taking a compaſſe fell upon the backs of the enemy, making a way through them. The Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa</hi> advertiſed of this danger, without expreſſing any ſhew that he ſhunned it, ſent word to the Baron of <hi>Lapithy,</hi> that wheeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with all the ſpeed poſſible, he with his men ſhould ſuſtaine that charge. The Baron o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed; but being preſently followed by the King of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> hee was taken in the way by the Duke of <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> There in an open place, their ſmall
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:169974:153"/>number being known, they were in ſuch manner ſtreightned, that they had not hope to ſave themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa,</hi> who ſaw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Baron was in, hopeleſſe to conquer, charged on to relieve him. <hi>Dorcone</hi> followed him, animating his to victory. He ſaid: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the enemy that flies and leaves the Field. Behold the Palmes which a Triumph promiſeth us. This miſerable Remnant that hath eſcaped our hands it behoves us to ſubdue, to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to our anger. Behold the Enemy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, not ſo much to over come, as to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Reſcue with all your force your friends from the madneſſe of this deſperate Foe, which runs to death. So having ſaid, he moved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Count, accompanied by all his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons.</p>
               <p>Cruelty triumphed in this new encounter, Every moment the Souldiers fell, and their own dangers gave them not leiſure to compaſſionate the miſeries of others. The Colours were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and diſordered in the battell, and the Army now loſt thoſe Parties that obſerved martiall Rules. The quantity of the dead ſerved as Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for King <hi>Vaſſileo's</hi> Souldiers, encompaſſed by ſo many Armes that defence was impoſſible. The ſlaughter that the Archers made was without number. <hi>Dorcone,</hi> not regarding that he was a King, concentred himſelfe among the thickeſt, hazarding himſelfe to every danger. He was followed by all the Princes, and thoſe of his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169974:154"/>Guard, who continually made vowes for his health and ſafety. The Duke of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> alſo followed by the Barons of <hi>Cordia,</hi> and of <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alo</hi> expoſed himſelfe to all perils. Now he broke the order of their Rankes, now encountring the moſt couragious, he gave leiſure to others to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the weakeſt. Finally, he managed his ſword with ſuch a fierceneſſe, that his enemies thought him a lightning. Yet nevertheleſſe this did not daunt the courage of his Adverſaries. The hope of Liberty, and the deſire of Victory made them feareleſſely to deſpiſe death. The Count of <hi>Terra Groſſa,</hi> in valour, and in the richneſſe of his Arms ſingular among the others, viſited the Squadrons one by one, exerciſing at one &amp; the ſame time the office of a private Souldier and Captain. He made uſe of commendations and rebukes, accordingly as the Actions of the Souldiers deſerved. He was ready to repaire their Loſſes, ſending al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies freſh Souldiers in their roomes that fell. He ſaid, We muſt, friends, either conquer or dye. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold there <hi>Arſinoe</hi> which expects you. And it is neceſſary that you open your way by your force; What will become of you, if you had rather dye flying than fighting? He dies not, that gloriouſly loſes his life, defending himſelfe, his Country, his Friends, and Children. He ſpoke theſe words with ſo much boldneſſe, that although he knew the danger, yet he ſeemed to feare none.</p>
               <p>He encountred in the greateſt terrour of the Fight the King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> conceiving he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the moſt glorious enterpriſe of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169974:154"/>it was the moſt difficult, he attempted to kill him. Three blowes he gave him, the one after the other, ſo mighty, that he fell downe ſenſeleſſe on the earth. He believing him dead, or at the leaſt mortally wounded, ran upon the Count, who finally being run through with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thruſts, after he had ſold his life at a deare price, breathed out his ſoule, which ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unwillingly to abandon that body, and may be gueſſed it was loath to go forth, fearing the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſo many Armes.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Dorcone</hi> being remounted, without having received any hurt, fell upon the Souldiers, who having loſt their Count deſpaired of their lives. In a ſhort time the Field ſhewed it had produced an infinity of Carkaſſes. There was nothing ſeen but dead men, nothing heard but ſuch as were trodden on and wounded. The <hi>Thracians</hi> were become ſo formidable, that there was not an eye that durſt looke them in the Countenance. The clamours of the Baron of <hi>Lapithy,</hi> who encouraged them to fight, were not heard: The feare of death being powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than all things. Whileſt he blamed their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice with many words of infamy, he was juſt ſtruck with an Arrow in the mouth, which he held open, whence ſilence and dying ſeized him at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>This death gave the laſt ſhake to the ſouldiers hopes; having none remaining that could regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their feares, nor bridle their Cowardice, they ſhewed their backs to their enemies. Many
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169974:155"/>retreated to the ſea, and many to ſave themſelves hid themſelves in Caves. But the greateſt part, carried by feare, ran they knew not whither, leaving their heads and their members to the diſcretion of their heeles. There were ſome that loſing their breath with long running, fell down an infamous prey to the horſe that purſued them. Others (Feare not leaving to them a diſtinction of dangers) ran of themſelves into the ſea, and dyed there, becauſe they would not dye; as if the waters had that pity which they deſpaired to find in men. But many, and thoſe of the moſt worthy, to whom death was not a terrour to daunt them, flying, and fighting, tooke the way which lead to <hi>Arſinoe.</hi> There they found that Fortune had preſented a Tragedy not inferiour to theirs.</p>
               <p>The Princes of <hi>Miſſia</hi> and <hi>Epirus,</hi> emulatours betweene themſelves, ran together to make a Pompe of their valour by the death of thoſe Souldiers, who, after <hi>Viralto</hi> was taken priſoner, aimed at nothing but to retire. There had not any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Finally, all the Chiefe, aſhamed to ſee their King in danger to be loſt, and their own duty adding courage to their feare, they made a ſtand afront the Enemy, ſo that their flight
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169974:155"/>might ſucceed with the leaſt dammage poſſible. The two Princes notwithſtanding had forced the Gates, entring with the Souldiers that fled, if the prevention had not come from the Walls.</p>
               <p>The ſlaughter being over, all thoſe Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into <hi>Dorcone's</hi> Tent, the which although it was ſecured from being aſſaulted, he would not nevertheleſs (it being about an houre after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet) put off his Armes, unwilling that the joyes for the Victory ſhould againe produce the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the night paſt: He made the Sentinells, and <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> to be doubled, to be ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe ſuddaine Chances which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happen to Conquerors; Fortune many times rejoycing to draw griefe out of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Arſinoe</hi> on the other ſide, ſorrow and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was ſeen in the face of all. Women, old men, and Children ran into the Temple, making vowes to the Gods for their ſafety. This night was ſo repleat with groanes, that they occaſioned horrour, even in thoſe Breaſts who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This lamented for his Son, this his Father, ſhe her Father, ſhee her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: And there figuring the enemy in the City victorious, and triumphing, increaſed their terror. The greateſt part of the Women altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the weakneſſe of their Sex, ran to the Walls to carry ſtones, and other inſtruments to reſiſt the Aſſailants. Others, (on whom Fear had not the power to cleare their mindes of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes)
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:169974:156"/>hid their Money, Jewels, and Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets in the moſt ſecret places, and the privateſt holes. Many giving themſelves over to griefe, were ſo over-whelmed in a dull ſorrow, that they were inſenſible to all things. And ſome over their little Children, deplored their owne, and their infelicity, feeding them more with teares then milk. In ſumme, every thing was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat with Confuſion, Terrour, and Amazement, that there was not an eye that had the boldneſs to take any ſleep; nor a member that deſired, or would have any repoſe.</p>
               <p>The Day, and the Light augmented their ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Loſs and the Danger appearing ever greater then the feare. The Field was lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all covered with dead bodies, that preſented to the ſight a ſpectacle ſo dolorous, that it would have enforced to ſorrow a breaſt of Marble. But all their ſadneſs notwithſtanding gave place to the griefes of <hi>Floridea,</hi> Her minde, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was deceived in its Auguries, aſſured her of her dammage, and the loſs of the Duke of <hi>File<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

This ſaid, he was ſafe; That, that he would come preſently. Others, that he was taken Priſoner; and many, that he was ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Although feare, that alwayes preſents things greater then they are, combated her; yet in her ſelfe ſhe was not void of deſperate hope, which
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:169974:156"/>after the manner of a Heart, is the laſt that dies in our affection. Sometimes being tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by paſſion, ſhe vented her ſelfe upon the Cowardice of the Souldiers; ſaying to them; Where, where (O you puſillanimous!) have you left your Generall? He that hath no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Intereſt in this Warre then your ſafety, hath hazzarded his life for you; and have you ſo vilely abandoned him? Perhaps you ſuppoſe you may be ſecure, without the protection of his valour. May be you perſwade your ſelves you may live, though he be dead. VVho hath had the Guard of his perſon? VVho was neare him in the Battaile? Friends, I am not afraid of unluckie Newes, being alwaies accuſtomed to griefe. Finally, underſtanding, that in the Entrance of the Enemies Rampiers, (it being impoſſible to relieve him) he was taken Priſoner; ſuddenly annimated by that Love which renders the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt breaſts valiant, altogether forgetfull of her owne dangers, ſhe went out of the walls, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like a mad woman towards the Tents of the <hi>Thracians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being ſtopped by the Guards, ſhe cryed to be carried to the King. There was not any that had the boldneſſe to deny her this requeſt; the ſimpler ſort believing her a Goddeſs: For juſt ſuch an one her beauty deſcribed her. She was ſeen to runne ſo ſwiftly over the dead bodies, without any ſigne of feare, that they could not imagine but ſhe was above humane. Shee was guided to the preſence of <hi>Dorcone,</hi> who with his Armes
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169974:157"/>on, diſcourſing with his, about the concluſion of the Warre, attended till <hi>Aurora</hi> had diſmiſſed the night. <hi>Floridea</hi> proſtrating her ſelfe at his feet, attempted with ſignes and teares to gain a pitty from them whom ſhe was to perſwade. The <hi>Thracian</hi> unable to ſuffer that that Beautie ſhould continue ſo languiſhing, commanded; That riſing ſhe ſhould expreſſe her deſires. Let the Magnanimous breaſt of your Majeſtie (added <hi>Floridea</hi>) vouchſafe pardon to the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the affection of an unfortunate woman. I well know that pitty reſides in Regall mindes; for they having the inſtruments to make happy, would not that their hearts ſhould be inferiour to their Fortune. I come then (O Magnanimous!) to ſupplicate you for an Action which will aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Glories to your Triumph and Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your Fame. In the firſt Battaile, an only Brother of mine became a prey to your Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

I adde not with new teares provocations to the genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the King of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> who ought not to receive Motions for his Munificence, but from himſelfe. I wipe them away, not becauſe I feele my griefe to waine, but not to offend the divinity of that minde which is not liable to Affections. I would offer any thing in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:169974:157"/>of ſuch a favour, if my poverty and yoer greatneſſe admitted of Gifts, I have not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to prepare you royall ones, nor you a mind to receive them: At the leaſt I ſhould give you thanks, but the bitterneſs of my ſorrow ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth me, and the greatneſs of the benefit permits me not. Let this alſo be an Adjunct to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of your Glories, that you can beſtow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on thoſe, who eve know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thanks.

Yet you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelfe, that all my ſpeeches ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Encomiums of your Liberality, and all my Vowes ſhall not ſupplicate the Gods, but to ſee you live eternally, as you ſhall live immortally in the memorie of all Ages.</p>
               <p>So ſhe held her peace, awaiting an Anſwer in ſuch a poſture, that in ſilence ſhe had voice, and entreaties, and peradventure alſo violence. All were perſwaded by theſe words, which came forth accompanied with a certaine Majeſty, that the gave a credit to her paſſion. The <hi>Thracian</hi> delayed his Reply, feeling his heart at one and the ſame time combated by divers affections. The Memory of <hi>Dianea,</hi> to whom he had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed all his Affections, would not give place to the beauties of <hi>Floridea.</hi> But fire cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall among aſhes: It may well preſerve it ſelf, but finally it will goe forth. He blaming the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of his thoughts, which obliged him to love an Object, which could be not loved, gave himſelfe over a prey to this new beauty; ſo much
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169974:158"/>the rather, for the ſeeing her in his power, added fomentations to his love, facilitating hope to him. He then anſwered:</p>
               <p>Faire Maid, if I by ſilence have entertained your hopes with fears, it was not becauſe I found my ſelfe unreſolved to pleaſure you. Lay the fault of my ſuſpenſion on your face, which aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth even thoſe that are willing to ſerve you. Your Brother ſhall be delivered, and all that which may accompliſh the vowes of your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. I know not, notwithſtanding what cruell pitty you have about you, impriſoning thoſe that give you Priſoners. You onely perhaps would do violences. Peradventure you diſdaine that others ſhould have the Valour to take Captive. But be it as it will, what ever depends on you, is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me. Know that in reverencing you, and loving you, I yeeld not at all to the Brother whom you ſeek for. If I ſhall live, Fortune ſhall no more glory to behold you a Supplyant. Do you alſo exerciſe that pitty which you have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floridea</hi> replyed not. The baſhfulneſſe that ſoon ſhadowed her face, tied alſo her tongue. She bowed, kiſſing the <hi>Thracians</hi> hands, who would not reſiſt it, to accreditate the beginnings of his Love to be of eſtimation. All the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came, among which, not perceiving the Duke, ſhe afreſh gave way to her teares. <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone</hi> omitted no diligence to have him ſought for among the dead; but that not availing, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Floridea</hi> ſhould be kept carefully. He
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:169974:158"/>was in ſuch wiſe enamoured on of her beauties, that without enjoying her, he perſwaded himſelf he could not live. He will'd that the Count of <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This was an old man, blemiſhed with the moſt enormous diſhoneſties. He had nothing in him but what was vice. Years that uſe to remember men of Repentance for their diſſoluteneſſe, in this man fomented ſenſualities. The fear of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, made him more covetous of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. By Arts the moſt diſhoneſt he had got poſſeſſion of his Maſters Affections, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of Cuſtomes conformable to himſelfe, could not but love him. His Vices raiſed him to that Degree of Honour; whereto others by vertue hardly arrived to by deſire. This man that with a preſence that counterfeiting goodneſs, would have beguiled warineſs it ſelfe, entred to ſpeake with <hi>Floridea,</hi> who ſitting on a bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed her infelicity. The firſt words were of Complement; the Count ſaying: That by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from his Majeſty he was come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her; promiſing her (for his part) all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſearch out all ſignes, that might diſcover her Brother. <hi>Floridea</hi> anſwered with ſo much the more humility; adding, that ſhe was accon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated in her Miſeries, that rendred the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch a King intereſted, and the good will of ſo worthy a Knight.</p>
               <p>The Count then taking occaſion began to ſay to her: Lady, if your countenance gave me not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:169974:159"/>of your Wiſedome, I ſhould enforce my ſelfe with words to make you believe what a gift Fortune, through the merit of your beauties hath beſtowed upon you. But acknowledging in your Arguings, that exceed the Diſcourſes of thoſe that have ſpent all the yeares of their life in Negotiations; I will onely ſay, that <hi>Dorcone</hi> hath made you worthy of his affections, and of his Embraces. See how Heaven compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the Reſentment of your teares, and how the Gods undertake the Protection of Beautie. I will not preſume to perſwade you, becauſe I cannot doubt you will ſlight the love of a King, whom to enjoy, the Goddeſſes in Contention would deſcend from Heaven. Theſe graces fall but on a few. To undervalue them, is to ſhew your ſelfe unworthy of them: and the rather, becauſe it would be an ungratefull act, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to oppoſe your ſelfe to the Deſires of a Prince, who hath overcome all delayes to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you, and who may obtaine that by force, which your wilfulneſs may deny him. Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your Love may perſwade him to greater matters. There are many <hi>Alexanders</hi> that eſpouſe their ſervants. The Opinion of the vulgar, and of thoſe in particular, that with deceitfull names, and vaine, betray the ſimplicity of maids, falls not upon Princes, that give Lawes without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any. There is not any thing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to a King, ſo it be agreeable to his pleaſure. I adde no more; not to prejudice your Election, and not to ſteale from you that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:169974:159"/>merit which your promptneſſe to his Majeſties Deſires may acquire for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floridea</hi> received ſo much diſpleaſure at the words of the Count, that the feare to ſee her ſelfe expoſed into the hands of the Enemies of her honour, could not make her forbeare thoſe words; which could not be ſpoken but with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. Although neceſſity preſented before her eyes the profit of Diſſimulation; notwithſtanding, ſhe would not ſuffer that her tongue ſhould ſeem baſe againſt thoſe that tempted her in her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Before ſhe anſwered him, ſhe ſtood a little in ſuſpence, to premeditate a proper Reply, and to give way to her anger, that it ſhould not ſtop, nor hinder her tongue. After ſhe added;</p>
               <p>I anſwer you, (good old Man) that you might not beleeve I aſſented with my ſilence to thoſe Propoſalls, unworthy of your age, and my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. You have ill imployed thoſe gray haires, whilſt you know not how to ſerve, but as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of infamous Actions. I cannot perſwade my ſelfe, that <hi>Dorcone</hi> would ſoile with blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the Graces he hath done me. I ſhould be undeſerving to have received them, if I had not his conſent to maintaine mine honour. I know not how a Carkaſſe of Fortunes fury can allure the pleaſure of a King. I rather believe it a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your perfidiouſneſſe, then a deſire of his Majeſty, who repreſenting on earth the Image of the Gods, cannot encline his heart to ſuch baſeneſſe. Every thing is lawfull to Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ſuppoſed, that a King will not put his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169974:160"/>hand into things illegall. He would be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this name, or to ſpeake better, he would have nothing of a King but the name, who is not mightier than others in all the virtues. And though Kings may do what they will, yet honour is without their juriſdiction. I have an hand, which though it cannot reſiſt the forces of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers incontinency, can nevertheleſſe ſettle my honour in a ſecure place. I have not an heart that can ſuffer me to be diſhonoured, nor hath your ſpeech perſwaſion to make me ſuch; your infamous employment for this time hath gained you nothing but the indignations of heaven, which by me ſhall be accelerated upon you, if I may one day ſit upon the Throne of my Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours.</p>
               <p>The Count was not troubled at this refuſall; being accuſtomed to know that women deny that with the greater earneſtneſs which they the moſt ardently covet. He would not reply any thing to her, either not too much to provoke her anger, or to let her ſtrive with her own affections; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knowing that Ambition is the Tyrant of women. He acquainted not the <hi>Thracian</hi> with <hi>Floridea's</hi> backwardneſſe, being confident to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome her at the ſecond encounter; not being able to perſwade himſelfe (by his experience in others, that a feminine boſome could long reſiſt the ſtroakes of Intereſt.</p>
               <p>In the meane while <hi>Dorcone</hi> ſpent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the day in conſults about finiſhing of the War. All the Cities of the Kingdome, upon
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169974:160"/>notice of the <hi>Thracians</hi> victory, fell voluntarily into the hands of the Conquerour. He looking on them all with a mercifull eye did no hurt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſave to thoſe of <hi>Cerannia.</hi> He made it be ruined to the Foundations, making all the ancient, and men fit to beare armes to be buried among thoſe Ruines alive; making Slaves, on the other ſide, of all the Women and Children. The night that followed this ſlaughter was ſo repleniſhed with Thunder, Lightning, and Thunderbolts, that it appeared that heaven agreed to foment the fury of the <hi>Thracians.</hi> Truly, it ſeemed that it would open Gulphs to bury thoſe Wretches who found heaven and earth conſpired to do them miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. All the Poles and Tents of the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were throwne down, torne, and ſcattered by the winds which blew with ſuch a violence, that many times the Souldiers were not ſafe from their fury. There was ſeen to fly through the field an abundance of divers things, with ſuch a confuſion of the Army, that one Troope of horſe would have been ſufficient to have conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them.</p>
               <p>The Guards that had the Cuſtody of <hi>Floridea</hi> had left her; although thoſe terrours would not ſuffer her to think of making an eſcape. The night grew more repleat with darkneſſe, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that if it had been obſerved it calmed the winds, which being afraid of themſelves had not the courage to preſſe upon thoſe ſhaddows. Torches lighted in a great number through all the Army ſerved not but to confound the ſight
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:169974:161"/>the more. <hi>Floridea</hi> ſtood there in a great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when ſhe heard her ſelfe called by name by a voice unknown to her. She was the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified beleeving it a Ghoſt; but perſwading her ſelfe after that it might be the ſpirit of <hi>Viralto,</hi> which came to invite her to death, or to guide her out of the hands of thoſe Barbarians, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a little courage, ſhe asked what it deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of her that it called her. That if it was a Ghoſt that intended to affright her, it was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſhe being alſo reduced into that ſame ſtate by her own griefe, and the injuries of Deſtiny. But on the other ſide, if it was the ſhaddow of him whom ſhe adored, that ſhe rejoyced at it, becauſe ſhe might make him ſee the greatneſſe of her Love. She heard it reply to her: That he was a man that deſired to deliver her from the captivity of thoſe who every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contrived treacheries againſt her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: that if ſhe would ſecure her honour and her life, ſhe ſhould follow him in ſilence. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridea</hi> obeyed, walking all that night, and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any danger inferiour to that which was threatned her by the <hi>Thracians.</hi> But ſhe felt for all that an alteration of the heart ſo vehement, that ſhe could not but prognoſticate ſome ill to her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>They arrived at the mouth of a Grot, juſt upon that time that darkneſſe vaniſhed, diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning perhaps to be trodden on by the horſes of the Sun. There ſhe ſuddenly perceived her guide to be <hi>Prodirto</hi> the Duke of <hi>Laſſimano.</hi> He had
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:169974:161"/>continued in the Court after the departure of the Prince of <hi>Create.</hi> Knowing <hi>Viralto,</hi> he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him daily, attending a time to revenge the offences received from him. The firſt day that <hi>Viralto</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Thracians</hi> he took notice of <hi>Floridea:</hi> but made no ſhew of it, waiting an opportunity for his deſignes. Seeing her enter among the enemies he followed her. He found no difficulty in concealing himſelfe among ſuch a multitude, having the habit, and the language of the <hi>Thracians.</hi> Taking the opportunity of thoſe darkneſſes he led her into that Cave, very well known to him, into the which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies retreated before he was wounded in that of <hi>Dianea. Floridea</hi> knowing him, received ſo grand a ſorrow, that ſhe fell in a ſwoone, with danger perhaps to have been killed among thoſe Rocks, if the Duke had not received her between his armes. Being returned to her ſelfe, ſhe ſaid to him:</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible (O cruell one) that thou art not yet ſatiated with the infelicity of my fortune? Is it poſſible that thy barbarouſneſſe ſhould not be extinct in the bloud of my Father, and my Brother, and that it is not buried in the ruines of my houſe? Perchance thou haſt ſtolne me from the <hi>Thracians,</hi> becauſe thou feareſt, that to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me, they had not inſtruments more inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane than thoſe of thy perfidiouſneſſe. Wicked Traitour, unfaithfull to thy Prince, and heaven, and thy ſelfe; preſerved till now alive to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh only the high judgements of the Gods,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:169974:162"/>who with the cruelty of the impious exercife the patience of the good. I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the the earth rendred execrable by the exceſſes of thy infamies, prepares not for thee at every ſtep either a Precipice, or a tombe. You Thunders of <hi>Jove,</hi> that exerciſe the furies of your anger upon towers and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, infenſible of your chaſtiſements, why ſtrike you not this perfidious, this wicked, this ſacrilegious man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prodirto,</hi> growne furious at theſe words, which, reproaching him for his enormities, could not be but diſpleaſing, comming againſt her vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanouſly, gave her many blows on the face, ſaying to her: Learne, impudent one, to injure thoſe who ſo many times have preſerved thee free from wrongs. Receive now the fruits of my anger, having not had the will to try thoſe of love. Let your Duke of <hi>Filena</hi> come now to free you from him, who hath an heart more cruell againſt thoſe he hates, than he hath it amiable to thoſe he loves. Enjoy now my indignation, of the which I have ſhewed my ſelfe ſo anxious. Becauſe you have abhorred my embraces, having given up your ſelfe to thoſe of others: Now to thy dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vexation I will take them more to triumph over thy obſtinacy, than to gather the moſt vile leavings of thy immodeſties.</p>
               <p>Thou lyeſt (O wicked man) replied <hi>Floridea;</hi> for there is not any that can boaſt himſelfe over my honeſty. But it is no wonder that a Traitour ſhould take away the fame of thoſe Princes
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169974:162"/>whom he will murther. I care not that thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt me, equally deſpiſing both thy love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. Diſtaine (cruell man) thy hands in my bloud: For I only remaine a Remnant of the barbariſmes of thy Infidelity. Thou haſt reaſon to kill me, that I may not witneſſe to the world that thou art the moſt infamous Traytour that lives.</p>
               <p>Then (added <hi>Prodirto,</hi> interrupting her) ſhall I neither have power nor puniſhment to bridle thy mordacious inſolency. Dares then the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity of an impudent woman thus far! So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he began to ſtrike her with ſo much anger, that the bloud ran from many places. She ſchree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out as loud as ever ſhe could, rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence him more, than for any reliefe ſhe might receive to her ſorrow; were ſhe ſecure of her honour, ſhe would not have ſhewed a reſentment for all the miſchiefes of the world; ſhe much more feared the love of <hi>Prodirto,</hi> than the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and injuries.</p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Floridea</hi> with bitings, blows, words, and ſchreeches fomented the furiouſneſſes of <hi>Prodirto, Aſtidamo</hi> the Prince of <hi>Creete</hi> was brought into a griefe not inferiour to hers. In a ſhort time he was carried to <hi>Creete,</hi> having in his voyage received no other diſcommodity than that which the abſence of <hi>Dianea</hi> occaſioned. Hefound them juſt a celebrating the Funerals of his Father and Mother, who both died in one day. He ſhewed a paſſion only to deceive the obſervation of Subjects, who rejoyce in the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:169974:163"/>tenderneſſe of their Princes. They ſeldome weepe that by the death of their Parents obtaine a Kingdome. Great gainings would ſtop teares in the eyes of pity it ſelfe. He ſuddenly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the alterations of the Kingdome, occaſioned by thoſe, who, by being of the bloud royall, had had ambitious hopes for the Crown. The deaths of ſome the moſt culpable terrified the boldneſſe of others. He forgot not to exerciſe his mercy towards the penitency of thoſe which ran to his feet. He well knew that thoſe Kingdomes were not ſtable which were builded upon bloud. He had, under the pretence of reducing his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obedience, raiſed an Army worthy of his greatneſſe. All haſtened to ſerve him with Armes, Money, and Men, to gaine a place in the affection of their new Prince. He, thanking eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, gave the higheſt Commands to thoſe who had the vaſteſt thoughts, not thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſafe by leaving them in <hi>Creete,</hi> leſt in his abſence they ſhould attempt any Innovation. Making afterwards, with the greateſt celerity poſſible, all the Ships and Galleys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be prepared in readineſſe, and, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquing all his Militia, he made them direct their Prores towards the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To avoid the injuries of heaven, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to take land in an Iſland uninhabited, with ſo much impatiency, that his complaints againſt the averſeneſſes of heaven was the leaſt of his ravings. Eight daies were paſt wherein the ſea continued his fury, when a Long-Boat, guided by
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:169974:163"/>foure Marriners, who fled from ſhipwrack, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Port: There was within it a Knight of no ordinary preſence, who, with two Squires, rendred thankes to the Gods that they had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the hands of death. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> went quickly to ſee them, and there knew the Knight, who was the Baron of <hi>Cormio,</hi> a Subject to King <hi>Vaſſileo.</hi> He enquired of him the news of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the cauſes of his voyage. He anſwered: That the King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> being diſpleaſed at the juſtice of King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> againſt his daughter, was departed from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with a reſolution to returne back with a powerfull Army. That he had been ſent in all haſte into <hi>Egypt</hi> to procure Aide from that King upon any condition: that he had obtained it, the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> promiſing, in leſs then two months either to enter into <hi>Thracia</hi> to call back <hi>Dorcone</hi> to the defence of his, or elſe to come to <hi>Cyprus</hi> with a potent Flect. That returning joyfull with this anſwer, he had been many daies toſſed by the ſeas, againſt which having neither force nor inſtrument to reſiſt, perceiving themſelves neare that Haven they were abandoned beyond the hope of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who having ſpent all her rigours with the Ship which carried them (it being ſwallowed by the waves) afforded me here a landing place, and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> could hardly ſuffer that he ſhould give a period to his diſcourſe, but he asked of what juſtice he ſpoke exerciſed againſt his daughter by King <hi>Vaſsileo.</hi> I (Sir) replied the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:169974:164"/>Knight, would not weary you with a new Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuppoſing you had been fully informed of it, it being every where knowne, that King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> underſtanding from his owne Daughter her ſelf, that without the aſſent of her Father, ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to a Marriage, he had made her be put to death in priſon with a ſorrow even to thoſe who loved her not. You have killed me, replyed <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidamo</hi> with a report ſo miſerable. He had ſcarce ſaid theſe words, but he fell down halfe dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Armes of his. Being returned to his ſenſes. he gave himſelf over to teares and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, with ſuch a reſentment of thoſe that waited on him, that they would have eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to dye the leaſt expreſſion of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>Fortune (he ſaid) how doſt thou know to torment this heart, which believed it ſelfe neare to felicity. Theſe Armies, this Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia which declare me one of the greateſt Kings of the world, ſerve to no other end but to augment my affliction. If one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes a poverty contrary to his deſires, he need not complaine but of Deſtiny: but he that in wealth and power envies not the felicity of <hi>Jove,</hi> feeles the greater torment, by how much the leſſe he can ſatisfie his appetites. Every great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath its contraries, neither is there autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or power which are not expoſed exceſſively to the anger of Heaven. I will not (friends) preſent my Griefes to you, for in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, perhaps my paine will be redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:169974:164"/>upon mee, and I have more ſtrength to endure it, then to expreſſe it. It ſhould not be great, whilſt my Tongue can conceale the greatneſſes of it. And if by the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, I be not compelled to reveale it, I would not ſpeake it, leſt I ſhould torment your mindes with the effects of pitty. Compaſſion would adde eaſe to my ſorrowes, which my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity wills ſhould torment me to an exceſſe. To have Companions, which is a grand Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the afflicted, is not convenient for him, who ought onely to be tortured by paſſion. But why doe I multiply in Complaints, having (to prove death in ſorrow) deſigned to bury them in my ſoule!</p>
               <p>He accompanied theſe words with ſo many teares, and ſo lively reſentments, that there was not any who would not have borne part of his Evill to have eas'd him. Now with a vehement Motion, and unquiet, he gave ſigne of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour he felt within his Breaſt. Now ſitting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, with an abundance of ſighs he ſhew'd, that his ſoule tormented, gave ſignes of leaving the body. Now he fixed a great while his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heaven, as if he implored the aide of the gods, or rather that he complained of them that agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with ſo many infelicities. The night came on, which inſtead of affording himſelf reſt, heaped afflictions on him. Thoſe ſilences, and thoſe horrours which uſually lull aſleep thoughts and ſadneſſes, could not now give a ſtop to the paſſions of a deſperate heart. Rather under the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:169974:165"/>ſhadow of night thoſe dolours ſeem to be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; for the which the light of the day would have reproved him of ſhame. He went to bed, but could not lie in it, but by minutes. Having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Command to his to withdraw, he went forth with the greateſt ſecreſie into the Iſland, where giving his heart to the dispoſall of his feet, he was carried into the thickeſt part of a wood, in the which there was neither foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep, nor ſigne that any body came there. There not ſeeing any witneſſes that might cenſure his paſsion, he beſtowed upon griefe all the teares his eyes could adminiſter. There was a little Fountaine with ſteps. Above it he caſt himſelfe in a careleſſe manner; pouring forth ſo great a Lamentation, that his words came not out but broken and imperfect. When his heart could no longer ſupply water to his eyes, his tongue under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took their Office; he ſaid:</p>
               <p>What wilt thou doe, O King of <hi>Creet,</hi> the true ſcope of all the miſeries of Fortune? What wilt thou doe, the ſole occaſion of the death of the moſt beautifull woman, that Heaven, Art, and Nature agreeing could frame? VVhat thing hitherto haſt thou not felt? To what infelicity haſt thou not been ſubject? VVretched, and miſerable King, what thing more wilt thou wait for, what thing more wilt thou hope for? To what greater Calamities wilt thou reſerve thy ſelfe? Dead is <hi>Dianca, Dianea</hi> is dead. Heart haſt thou patience to ſuffer it? And haſt thou Mouth the boldneſſe to ſpeak it? Pardon me, O
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169974:165"/>happy ſoule, Pardon me; beloved ſoule, that I know not how to die at the newes of thy death. Peradventure heaven would that thou ſhouldſt live in me, the Cruelty of thy Father having denyed thee to live in thy ſelfe, or rather it would honour thy Sepulcre with the teares of one who hath infinitely loved thee, and in whom his heart ſhal ſooner die then his affection. I live by the ſevere judgment of the juſtice of the gods, who having known me innocently guilty, will nevertheleſs puniſh me, by not ſuffering me to die. Unhappy <hi>Dianea,</hi> ſlaine and condemned by thy Spouſe and Father! Miſerable old man, why haſt thou been willing to defile thy hands in the bloud of thy Daughter? Cruell Father? wicked Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Father unworthy the name of a Father; Where are ſuch impious Cruelties practiſed? Impieties ſo cruell? An onely Daughter of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo ſingular, that they would have awaken'd Emulation, and Envy in thoſe of heaven, who in Prudence, and in the other Vertues, gave not preheminence to the wifedome of the moſt wiſe, he hath ſacrificed to his fury. Then Errours, and the Errours of Love can finde no pitty in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a Father. Why hadſt not thou Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſo cruell, that thou mightſt not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thy ſelfe in the life of thy Daughter? But whither doth my paſſion tranſport me, and my grief? The Father hath not been the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his Daughter; I am guilty of this crime, I have ſlaine her, the ſacrilegious blow procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from my hands. And guilty of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:169974:166"/>ſhall I live? ſhall it then be true, that I can endure the killer of <hi>Dianea</hi> to live? No, no <hi>Dianea:</hi> behold the bloud of thy greateſt Enemy, which is as voluntarily offered to thy death, as unwillingly he deprived thee of life. If among ſhades there is a correſpondency of Affection, or memorie of a Benefit, I hope that thou wilt be wholly mine, ſeeing with how much readineſs, without ſparing of my bloud, I know to revenge thee.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, he drew his ſword, fetching ſome deep ſighes, fixing his eyes on heaven: Now full of pitty, now of fury, and ſet it to his breaſt to have ſlaine himſelfe. The which doubtleſs had happened, if a moſt beautifull Lady, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obſerved, had heard a great part of his Lamentations, had not ſtaid him, taking the ſword out of his hand. He was ſo diſpoſed to die, that he fell, without ſeeing who hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from it. Breathing a languiſhing ſigh, he ſaid: You doe nothing that with an unſought for pitty endeavour to ſave my life. It is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Commiſeration to kill me, then to let me live, for that would be the onely eaſe to my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. And beſides, there is not any that can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deſperate men from death.</p>
               <p>Theſe words being finiſhed, he fixed his Eies on her, who having got his head into her Lap, enforced her ſelf to conſolate him. Knowing the Effigies of <hi>Dianea,</hi> he began to cry out; Now, (O Friend!) I am ſure of the greatneſs of your affection, ſince you have not been unwilling to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:169974:166"/>grace me with theſe laſt Offices. But why will you be cruell to me with a pitty, which doubly torments me? I cannot out-live you, neither can I live without you. <hi>Dianea</hi> her teares for a while being ſtay'd, anſwered him; Friend, if you deſire the Company of <hi>Dianea,</hi> live! For I am alive. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> perceiving that it was not a Ghoſt, as at firſt he was perſwaded, and that the Reports of her Death were falſe, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in a moment his paſſed Commotions, ſo gave up himſelfe a prey to Joy, that he had like to have periſhed; ſo great a ſwooning comming upon him that it poſſeſſed all his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>After his ſpirits were recovered, they fell to embracings, with that tenderneſſe of affection as their affection could expres. They gazed upon one another, not crediting the truth, their hands, nor their eyes. They multiplied their embraces and kiſſes, nor had afforded an end to thoſe Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if the day being much ſpent, they had not been come upon by the Knights, who were in ſearch for their King, not without doubting ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
               <p>Then they redoubled their joyes, his ſhewing <hi>Dianea</hi> to them, whom with ſo deſperate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents he had bewailed as dead. They all came to kiſs her hands, reverencing her as their Queen. With theſe welcomes they retired to the Fleet, and the Tempeſt being ceaſed, <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> gave order for departure. But before they undertook their Voiage to <hi>Creet, Dianea</hi> gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how ſhee eſcaped the Anger of her
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:169974:167"/>Father, and how ſhe fled fram the Dangers of Death.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Hiſtorie of <hi>Dianea</hi>'s Eſcape.</head>
               <p>MY Father (ſhe ſaid) was obſtinate in his Reſolutions to make me aſſent to Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als with the <hi>Thracian.</hi> I to render him diffwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, uſed all thoſe Meanes, and all thoſe Arts, which were ſubminiſtred tome by neceſſity and love. All was in vain, for being the more exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated he came to force me. Then eſteeming ſilence a greater crime then the former, I caſt my ſelfe at my Fathers feet, giving him a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our amorus practiſes, yet proſecuted with promiſe of marriage. My Father altered in ſuch manner, that conſigning me to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, he would that the Law ſhould be obſerved, which condemned all thoſe to death, that born of Royall bloud, preſumed to marry themſelves. For me there was no pitty. Thoſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell endeavoured all wayes to ſave me, but they could not obtaine from the King that the Law ſhould be altered. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prato</hi> obtained through favour to be my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in my Sepulcher.</p>
               <p>They uſe in <hi>Cyprus</hi> (and I believe it is known to you) to bury thoſe who have any Characters of Nobility, in a vault under ground, one or more perſons of thoſe who loved them beſt in life, continuing there a yeare. The Dutcheſs feigned, that one of my Damſels was elected
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:169974:167"/>for her Companion in this Function, who of Counſell in the Intention of the Dutcheſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Executioner of the ſentence, making her ſelfe took in my ſtead. The Dutcheſs gave an apparance to the Deceit, ſcattering ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Teares, and ſuch Sighes, that they deafned the Aire. She acquainted me with it juſt at that time, wherein prepared to dye, I had not an hope to comfort me. She made me put on the Cloathes of the Damſels, and I entred with her into the Tombe, which was prepared for me.</p>
               <p>The Report of my death was ſpread over the whole City with an univerſall ſorrow. There was not any that made doubt of it, whilſt my owne Father beleeved no otherwiſe. I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo buried many dayes, with ſuch a paſſion, that I ſhould rather have choſen death a thouſand times. Finally, one night, (though there was never known neither Light nor day) we found by chance a ſecret Portall, which led into a Grot. Having lighted a Torch, we walked to ſee the end; It brought us into a field neare the Sea ſhore, there finding by chance a Veſsell which was upon ſaile, we went toward <hi>Creet,</hi> with the thought of finding you.</p>
               <p>Fortune, that knowes to ſhew her ſelfe an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the moſt juſt deſires, made us fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of <hi>Traute,</hi> a Pirate. He ſcarce ſaw me, but he had a deſigne of me, believing me Daughter to the Dutcheſs, for ſuch I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gave out my ſelfe. A great deale of his
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:169974:168"/>fierceneſſe being layed aſide, he requeſted my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with ſuch humility, that I wonder in my ſelfe how for love he could be ſeparated from himſelf. I, inanimated by his humiliations, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for a time to be able to diſpoſe of my ſelf to his will. Having obtained this occaſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, I got the Dutcheſs to ſpeake to one of the Pyrates, who next to the <hi>Traute</hi> was in chiefe Command. Our enterpriſe being in good order, and our hopes agreeing, the Dutchels taking <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> aſide (for ſo was the Pyrate named) ſhe ſaid to him:</p>
               <p>Son, I will not ſpeake at large becauſe time permits me not. I would not that my tongue ſhould make jealous ſo many eyes, and ſo many eares as obſerve us. My daughter is ardently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of you; ſhe hath perceived that you have not diſdained to looke on her with ſome liking, whereupon ſhe gives you to underſtand that ſhe will rather make an election of death than conſent to be anothers. She beſeeches you therefore, if her affection be pleaſing to you, to defend her from the violences of <hi>Traute.</hi> He dayly aſſaults her, and if your valour doth not oppoſe it, he will ſhortly uſe force. Then hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward it will be your thought to prepare a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for thoſe things which are dedicated to you, and not to ſtaine your honour with the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. That things recommended to your prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould become a prey to the inſolency of others.</p>
               <p>Theſe words in ſuch manner won poſſeſſion
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:169974:168"/>over the heart of <hi>Pilane,</hi> that he anſwered: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I thanke you for the occaſion you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me to quiet my heart, which already I have ſacrificed to the beauties of your daughter.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Traute</hi> will contend with me for her, he ſhall prove what the force in the breaſt of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can do. In this meane while, to avoid the injuries of heaven, and the ſea, which threatned death to the moſt dauntleſſe, we retired into this Iſland in a Port unhabited. Here was a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per prepared, where all the Pyrates ſat downe, willing alſo that we ſhould ſit; when they were full of meat and wine they fell into a thouſand diſhoneſties, and <hi>Traute</hi> by force caſt his armes about my neck eſpying me neare him. <hi>Pilane</hi> plucked him back by the arme, ſaying to him: <hi>Traute,</hi> That prey belongs not only to you which is made common to all. At thy pleaſure thou ſhalt be Patron of the things which belong to thy part, not of thoſe which not being divided appertaine to all; you have been choſen the head, but not a Tyrant, and you not obſerving the Laws of your election, neither am I bound to obſerve thoſe of obedience.</p>

                  <hi>Traute,</hi> not accuſtomed to injuries, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by wine, threw at him a great Bowle of ſilver, ſaying to him: So the raſhneſſe of thoſe is to be corrected who refuſe to obey. This of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was not without reſentment, becauſe <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> who ſtood upon warineſſe, wounded him with a knife in the breaſt, and killed him. The others ſuddenly betooke them to Armes, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:169974:169"/>they being almoſt all overcome with wine, their ſtroakes were not but mortall. I then ſaid to the Dutcheſs: Mother, Let us go hence not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a prey to the Conquerours. My feare car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying me into the thickeſt part of the wood, I beleeved that the Dutcheſs followed me, and was not aware of it, but after a great while that ſhe had not been with me. The griefe I had at it I leave to them to conſider, who knew how well I loved her. I would to have found her have turned thence back again, but night comming upon me I could not. I continually wandred, my paſſion keeping me in a perpetuall motion. Laſtly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by your teares I have found my <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> than whom, through the benignity of the Gods, I could not attaine to a grace more deſired, nor more unexpected.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe was ſilent, redoubling her Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> not being able, but with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſignes of conſolation, to expreſſe the joy which his heart felt. He ſent many Knights in ſearch of the Dutcheſſe, who returned without having received any notice, yet the comfort to ſee themſelves united mortified in great part the griefe they received at ſuch a loſſe. For all this <hi>Dianea</hi> would not depart thence before ſome Galleys had took a circuit round the Iſland. They returned with news of the death of the Pyrates, but there was not any that could give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing elſe. Laſtly, they appointed their departure towards <hi>Creete,</hi> ſo invited by the ſea and the winds which recalled them to their voyage.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:169974:169"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floridea,</hi> in the meane while ploughed in a Sea more perilous and fierce, with making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt the forces of the Duke, ſhe was become ſo ſtrengthleſſe, that already her hands ſtrived no more for victory agaiſt the Ardour of that impious man who attempted to diſhonour her. Her mouth, that with bitings had afforded defences to the purity of her heart, could ſcarce utter ſome languiſhing Ah me! which being ecchoed to by thoſe Rocks would have mollified the Duke himſelfe, if that love and diſdaine had not eſtranged him from himſelfe. He having ſcratched her face in many places, which was an adjunct to the horrours of his fierceneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſtrike her with ſuch an unmercifulneſſe that I know not how his hands were not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at ſo infamous a wickedneſſe. There were no more defences in the miſerable <hi>Floridea;</hi> Her fleſh either black or torne, her haire was rufled and rent; Her eyes, enlanguiſhed by griefe and teares, durſt not look up not to ſee the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of her ſhame; Her ſpred Armes gave boldneſſe to that impious man to redouble his Aſſaults the more.</p>
               <p>He was now ready to ſteale the fruits of his love, when thoſe languiſhing voices called a Knight to their protection, who ſeeing thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences, and knowing to whom they were uſed (accidents not being able to raze from the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Lovers the remembrance of the beloved) he began to crie to the Duke that he ſhould ſtay, if he would not be ſlain as baſely as he was employed.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:169974:170"/>
                  <hi>Prodirto</hi> changed his anger into fury, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a mightier paſſion than for that which retards the delights of the ſenſe; whereupon he ſaid:</p>
               <p>Knight, you ſhall feele the reward which thoſe gaine who with raſhneſſe intermeddle in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of others. So ſaying, he gave him a thruſt, which his armes falſifying made a little wound. That hurt coſt him deare, for he ſuddenly found himſelfe ſtruck on the head, from whence began to run a great abundance of bloud. For all this <hi>Prodirto</hi> ſhewed no ſignes of Cowardiſe, now rewarding, and now warding the blowes of his Adverſary. He uſed dexterity and ſtrength ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as his judgement gave rules and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements to his hand. The Vows of <hi>Floridea,</hi> with which ſhe ſtrove to ſupplicate the pity of the Gods, promiſed her no other victory but that of hope. They were both wounded when they drew back to take wind. The Knight blaming his weakneſs, which ſuffered him not to attaine the victory, cried out, O Gods, what judgement may be formed of your providence, whileſt you refuſe to aſſiſt to the protection of thoſe who defend juſtice! One only man, ſpotted with the moſt unworthy Characters of infamy, hath ſtrength to put me in danger of my life, not only not to overcome. With theſe vowes he ran to aſſaile the Duke, who knowing him by his voice, was daunted in ſuch manner, that having no longer the heart to defend himſelfe, he would have fled away, but the Knight prevented him,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:169974:170"/>for with two redoubled blowes he tooke away his life.</p>
               <p>This end had <hi>Prodirto</hi> the Duke of <hi>Laſſimano,</hi> a man of inimitable conditions, if diſhoneſty and ambition had not been predominant. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Wars he gained no ordinary name, and in his Country he had not Equalls. In battells it was not diſcerned which was the mightier in him, either Prudence, or Fortune. His Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhewed the ferocity of his heart, though his Fortune and Eyes manifeſted his perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Of his Cuſtomes it is not able to frame a judgement. He was bold in his reſolutions, neither truſted he ſecrets but to himſelfe. He found death from his hands for whom he ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more had woven ſnares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Floridea</hi> caſt her ſelf at the feet of the Knight, who making himſelfe known to her for <hi>Viralto,</hi> (who, having eſcaped from thoſe that kept him, was come thither by chance) there was not any externall ſigne which ſhe made not to declare her joy. She wept, ſwooned, cried out; and with centuplicated embraces it ſeemed that ſhe would make her ſelfe one with her beloved. Theſe firſt impetuouſneſſes being paſſed over, ſhe ſaid:</p>
               <p>Supernall Gods, that by your unknown wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from poyſons extract Antidotes, and from Lamentations joy; I know not how to render you thankes for ſo many felicities which have conquered my deſire. If all theſe words were ſoules, and all they conſecrated to your honours, they would not be ſufficient to tender you thanks
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:169974:171"/>for ſuch a benefit. Becauſe by your goodneſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the leaſt expreſſion is accepted of, I have humbly thanke you, O Celeſtiall Deities, O Supreame Intelligences. From you I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my life, the which only to day I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to deſire. To day new borne I begin to live. To live with the torments of an amorous paſſion hath no other of life but the name and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The ſtreightneſſes of the World, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Love, the anger of Deſtiny, the loſſe of my Father, and Brother, and of my Country, have been all inſtruments to felicitate me. There is not any that ſhould complaine of ill. Mortals accuſe not Fortune as the Miniſter of your infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities; for the providence of the Gods knows how to draw Aſhes from Glory, and Glory from Aſhes. Whileſt ſhe ſaid theſe words, ſhe hung about <hi>Viralto's</hi> neck, and it ſeemed that with a covetouſneſſe of deſires ſhe was inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all the demonſtrations of joy, or rather that ſhe would hold him ſo embraced, as if ſhe doubted the truth of her ſight and feeling. They waited for the night, to depart thence with the greater ſecurity, becauſe the <hi>Thracians</hi> held all the Iſland.</p>
               <p>In this meane while King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> maintained himſelfe with the Reliques of a beaten Army and driven into <hi>Arſinoe</hi> from moment to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expecting death. After the impriſonment of <hi>Viralto,</hi> he gave the Command of the Army to the Count of <hi>Salinera,</hi> who for wiſdome and affection had few Equals in the ſervice of his
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:169974:171"/>Prince. The Count having regard to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his men, had no other thought but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Wells from aſſaults. He had neither Forces, nor the boldneſſe to joyne Battail with them, who rendred audacious by Victory, and their number boaſted themſelves invincible. The great abundance of Proviſion that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> ſuffered not the beſieged to feele the incommodities of a ſiege. On the other ſide, the <hi>Thracians</hi> being become ſecure by the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs of their enemies, wore away all their dayes in Chaſes or Banquets.</p>
               <p>One day the two Princes of <hi>Miſſia</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the chief of the Army, met together in the <hi>Scythian</hi> Kings Pavilion. Heated with meates and Wine, they fell into divers Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. How much the more Fire is ſuppreſt, ſo much the more it operates with greater force. Some propoſed, what was the moſt unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing for a Knight? The doubt diſpleaſed not, becauſe there was not any that feared to have in himſelfe any thing unworthy of a Knight. The Opinions were as various, as were the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's, and the humours of thoſe that diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scythian,</hi> accommodating his words to his heart, ſaid; To flye from Dangers is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleble blemiſh of a Knights Reputation: Who would not encounter death, hath not an undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe: who hath not that feare, and who feares is baſe; and Cowardile is that, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:169974:172"/>all things is contrarie to the Glories of a Knight. A Knight ought not to ſuffer injuries, no not from thoſe who are much his Superiours in Fortune. If he encounters not dangers to prepare a Revenge, he blemiſhes his name with notes of Infamy. VVhen perils enforce a Knight to make Reſiſtance, it is pure neceſsity, not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. He ought to exceed others, who would be greater then others, He that with a virile leaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reneſs waits that Fortune ſhould preſent him Subjects to trie himſelfe, is obliged to Fortune, not to himſelfe. Even Cowards ſometimes will maintaine a Buſſle. In briefe, the animoſity to create perils, is the prime glory. As to attend that Chance, ſhould deliver a City into his hands, is the mightieſt ſhame to a Knight. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Sun would merit Reproaches, if with a precipitate and continuall motion, it ſhould daily ſeek for dangers among ſhades. In atchieving is honour, and in things hard by others, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ſaid; That ſo high Rewards being due to faithfulneſs, he could not perſwade himſelfe, that more blameable things could be in a Knight then infidelity. This would ſoile the lights of the Sunne, not onely the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men. An unfaithfull man is abhorred by all, becauſe all feare his Treacheries. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is a thing ſacred, the firſt daughter of <hi>Jove,</hi> the honour of men, and of the gods. Without this neither the earth nor the ſea would enjoy any peace. It is a particular Deity, which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:169974:172"/>reſides ſilently in thoſe breaſts that poſſeſſe it. A man otherwiſe void of this, may be termed a Carkaſſe: And leſſe, he is more vile then nothing. The Dammages of Infidelity are much more mightier then that which can be conceived in the minde, or expreſſed by the tongue.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Tinia</hi> would that it ſhould bee Ingratitude. And what other (ſaid he) can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate the birth and the vertues of a Knight, but Ingratitude, abominable in all. A Knight is elected to chaſtiſe thoſe that acting ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, offend Heaven, Nature, and their Friends. Now how much the mightier will his Reproach be, when he falls into that vice the Treſpaſſes againſt which he is made choice of to puniſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All other faults carry with them ſome excuſe, or ſome Appearance of Reaſon. Onely Ingratitude hath no pretence that can excuſe it, hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that can defend it. It is a vice ſo deteſtable, that it becomes even odious to thoſe that exerciſe it. Whoever is unthankfull is unſaithfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe he rebels againſt thoſe obligations which he owes to the favours of others. He is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, becauſe he torments the Liberallity of thoſe to whom he is knowne beholding. In ſumme, all Vices are ſeen in ingratitude, and therefore an unthankfull Knight is unworthy of the name of a Cavalicre.</p>
               <p>The Baron of <hi>Cardia</hi> maintained that Cruelty was the moſt blame-worthy thing in a Knight. Cruelty (he added) is the moſt certaine Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of, or Folly, or of Covetouſneſſe. To be
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:169974:173"/>ſhort, all Vices are Vices; but Cruelty holds the preheminence. It ſpoiles, unbowels, unſoules the world. It is the worſt of all things, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that from it all the worſt things proceed. Who is cruell, is vile, a deſire of Blond not reigning but in thoſe Boſomes which are corrupt. He is an enemy of Nature, ſince he procures the Deſtruction of his owne ſpecies. He offends the Gods, that with pitty onely have gained di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes. He injures himſelfe, becauſe by the death of others he robs himſelfe of thoſe Duties which would have afforded him a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority among others. Laſtly, he is the worſt of Animals, the which although they be void of Reaſon, are not nevertheleſſe without pitty.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> with his uſuall morda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſaid; That Love was the moſt deteſtable thing in a Knight. This (cried he) is that that diſturbes the Intellect, that contaminates the Reaſon, that tyrannizeth over the Will, and that makes a man different from himſelfe. Who loves, betraies himſelfe in the tyranny of a face, who knowes not to obey any thing, but affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor knowes not to be faithfull but to thoſe who alwayes betray. Love is a ſpecies of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſince it ſubjects the will of that heart to the which the Gods have preſcribed no lawes, but voluntary.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Miſſia</hi> uſhered in theſe Reaſons with a laughter, repleat with contempt, holding his eyes continually fixed upon the Prince of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus.</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:169974:173"/>He who in his owne conceit was loſt in love, thought that thoſe words wounded his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſo much the more, becauſe upon him all their looks were caſt, as upon himalon who was ſubject of this Diſcourſe. He having no longer ſufferance to ſee himſelfe injured, interrupting him, ſaid to him: Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> if your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your Opinion without thought to wrong me, I ſhall take no Reſentment at it, becauſe the Table even permits thoſe things, which ſhould not be ſpoke. If I have loved in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I repent not; becauſe my Affections have not been unworthy. VVho is ſo bold to reprehend me, lies, and peradventure blames love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is unworthy to be beloved. Declare your ſelfe then, becauſe I am not accuſtomed to be reproached, and in particular by you in theſe Errours.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Miſſia</hi> anſwered: I ſpoke by Chance, dictated by Reaſon. But that you ſhould not believe that I ſay this for fear of your Anger, I will make it good with my ſword, that having loved without Moderation, you have done a thing unworthy of a Knight; and therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited for it a publick reprehenſion. The Prince of <hi>Epirus,</hi> let him not finiſh theſe words, but drawing (in diſdaine) his ſword, he flew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> who doing the ſame, met him. The Tables went ſuddenly to the ground, and all thoſe Knights with their naked ſwords interpoſed themſelves to quiet them. The two Princes notwithſtanding, ſtaid not a jot,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:169974:174"/>both deſiring that the death of the one ſhould ſerve as a Victime to the Revenge of the other. They beſtowed their blowes at randome, holding equally all thoſe for their Enemies, who for all they interpoſed themſelves, ſhewed themſelves Neuters. Clamours already were multiplyed, and Fame ſpreading the wounds and deaths of theſe two Princes, enforced all to betake them to their Armes, with a Confuſion equall to the Perill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorcone,</hi> at notice of this, came into the place of Contention. The two Princes ſeeing the King, drew back, but not laying aſide that Ire, which in their hearts was implacable. He being informed of the Cauſe of the Quarell, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by all meanes to perſwade them to peace. But all became fruitleſſe, by reaſon the Prince of <hi>Epirus</hi> would that he of <hi>Miſſia</hi> ſhould unſay whatever he had ſpoke to injure him. On the other ſide, the Prince of <hi>Miſſia</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he would not give ſatisfaction to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from himſelfe he had received injuries. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the <hi>Thracian</hi> having no greater authority over them, then that which they were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let him have, was content that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in publike Liſts they ſhould determine their Quarrell.</p>
               <p>With all ſpeed all retired to their Tents to arme them, whilſt a moſt large place was prepared for the Combate. Ten thouſand ſouldiers, with the Baron of <hi>Racara,</hi> had the Guard of the Camp, to the end that they might not permit, that either
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:169974:174"/>by word or ſigne the Combatants ſhould be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured. The Souldiers ran in ſtrife to get the beſt place, as if that Battaile was made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the ſight. Some in their deſires favoured the Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> others him of <hi>Epirus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as theſe Princes ſuited to the Genius of thoſe, who for the moſt part love and hate without reaſon.</p>
               <p>But the wiſer ſort notwithſtanding abhorr'd that fight which could not be determined but to their owne dammage. The Victorie either on the one, or the other fide, could not but prove funebrous.</p>
               <p>In this meane while, there was heard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Pavillion of the Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> ſuch clamours, that they ſeemed to deafen Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This was the occaſion of it: The King of the <hi>Scythians</hi> had with his owne hand armed the Prince, taking notice of all the Armes with a diligence not ordinary, when he ſaid to him; Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> you are to fight againſt the moſt couragious ſword of the world. The Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, having his heart and eyes without feare: May be you have an ill opinion of my valour? The <hi>Scythian</hi> anſwered, I know you are of ſuch a Generoſity, that you yeeld not to any whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but nevertheleſſe, you are to combate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one, who hath had more Victories then Foiles; and this makes me preſage your deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The Prince was alter'd at theſe words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaid; If you had loved me, you would
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:169974:175"/>have had a more worthy an opinion of my valour. Auguries ſo infelicious, (although deſpiſed by my undauntedneſſe) ſettle me in a minde, that you are intereſted with my Enemies, and that you come to tempt me to Cowardize, to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thoſe with terrifying me. The <hi>Scythian,</hi> not accuſtomed to permit, that the pride of his heart ſhould lend an eare to ſuch like Reproaches, added; I would to Heaven Prince that your hand correſponded to your tongue, and that you were as valorous in ſtriking, as you are in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Notwithſtanding, if Fortune favour you with Victory, I will that you ſhall render mee an account of what you have ſpoke, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in my patience then your valor. The Prince replyed, that then and alwayes he would make him know, that he ſpoke unworthily, putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubt his force, and his undauntedneſs. The <hi>Scythian</hi> was not longer able to refrain, but with his ſhut hand came againſt the Prince, who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand to his ſword, began to lay at him with many blowes. The <hi>Scythian</hi> had nothing but a ſword, and yet he defended himſelfe ſo well, that for the moſt part he deceived the eye, and the hand of the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorcone</hi> arrived juſt upon that time there, when tardency could not but be perilous, becauſe the Souldiers of the Prince, and the <hi>Scythian,</hi> were run with Armes to aide their Lords. The <hi>Thracian</hi> attempted by all meanes to appeaſe them, making uſe of both his authority and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, when in the Tent of the Prince of <hi>Epirus</hi>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:169974:175"/>the like ſhoutings were heard: ariſing from a Contention, perhaps greater than the former. The Prince of <hi>Epirus</hi> was armed by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of many Knights, which reached him, and looked to his Armes. The <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> willing to give him his ſword, ſaw that it had written on it; <hi>The Sword of the Heires to Mars.</hi> VVith a mighty earneſtneſſe he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted how he attained the poſſeſſion of that Sword. The Prince anſwered, that the King his Father had won it by ſtrength of Armes, killing a Knight that wore it. The <hi>Infante</hi> added, I know not Prince, whether you underſtand the ſecret of this ſword. This is a gift which <hi>Mars</hi> was willing to beſtow on his Poſterity. To me it belongs more then to any other. By my paternall and mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Line I am deſcended from the God of VVar. To thoſe that would have a larger Information, I engage my ſelfe to make this good by ſtrength of Armes. Provide your ſelfe therefore of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sword, for this ſhall not goe forth of my hands but with my ſoule.</p>
               <p>The Prince full of indignation, taking a Lance, would have ſtrook the <hi>Infante,</hi> who being aware of it, made the Blow prove in vaine. After they continued fighting, there being not any that had the courage to interpoſe, the pitty of many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taugt others, that there is not a greater Folly, then to procure the ſafety of others with danger to themſelves. <hi>Dorcone</hi> ranne thither, leaving in the Prince of <hi>Miſſia's</hi> Pavillion, the Duke of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> that he might not ſuffer any Inconveniency to enſue. He propoſed a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:169974:176"/>thouſand Offers, mentioned infinite waies to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them. He interpoſed Entreaties, and deſired time to decide their Controverſie; but all was in vaine, whilſt obſtinate, they would then put an end to their Quarrel. The <hi>Infante</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lend him the Sword, ſo it were requeſted with ſome humility. The Prince anſwered, that all the force of the world ſhould not be ſufficient to make him deſirous to borrow that which abſolutely was his owne.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Dorcone,</hi> leaving here ſuch a Guard, that he might feare no worſe, would have the Advice of his Counſell upon this. Whilſt the Baron of <hi>Falarta</hi> bore now from one ſide, then from another the Commiſſions of the King for the deciſion of ſo many differences, he met with a mightier then the others. He haſting by his Majeſties Orders, a Dog of the <hi>Infante's</hi> of <hi>Armenia's</hi> ran under his Legs, and made him fall to the ground. The Baron changed at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſo much the more, perceiving the laughter of the by-ſtanders, and of the <hi>Infante</hi> in particular: whereupon drawing his Sword, at one blow he killed the Dog. The <hi>Infante</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the wrong to his Dogge done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, gave him a ſtroke with ſuch a violence, that the Spectators doubted of the Barons life: He, avoiding the blowes, withdrew from the Aſſaults of the <hi>Infante,</hi> who, with that his fury had no other effect, but to gaine ground on the Baron, at the ſame time tiring himſelfe out of breath. The Baron reſolute to ſtrike, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:169974:176"/>to the impetuouſneſſe of his anger, but conformably to the rules of occaſion, expected that this fury ſhould weaken his Intellect and ſtrength. When he perceived his ſtroakes grew more faint and ſlow, he drowned his ſword in the body of the <hi>Infante,</hi> fixing him to earth in an eſtate neither to entreat for, nor to receive his life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Armenians,</hi> not able to endure ſo fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous a ſpectacle, tooke armes to revenge the death of their Prince. The <hi>Thracians</hi> did the ſame to carry the Baron out of danger. All the Campe betooke them to Armes, making ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all thoſe which would make head. The Prince of <hi>Epirus</hi> and <hi>Miſſia</hi> had opportunity to meet, notwithſtanding that the <hi>Scythian</hi> and the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ran always between them. The Souldiers were all crouded up to help their Princes, laying upon one another with ſo much cruelty, that a greater they could not have uſed towards their enemies. Being encloſed within the Liſts, and in their Tents, they were ſlaine without reſiſtance, ſo ſtreight a place not able to containe ſuch a multitude. They that were trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot were more than the wounded, men and horſes contending with an equall fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The Squadrons were in a manner united, ſo that there was not roome to retire or fly. They ſtrooke with their bodies no leſſe than with their weapons. In ſo cloſed a fight there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope but to dye. All equally were enemies, and many times the Souldier killed him who had
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:169974:177"/>ſaved his life. Nothing was heard but confuſed cries, languiſhing ſchreekes, that, mixed with the noiſe of Armes, formed to the eare a ſound moſt dreadfull which threatned death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thracians,</hi> by reaſon they were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in number, made the more ſlaughter of the others, although alſo they made the greater loſs: <hi>Dorcone</hi> cried out, but was not heard, he was not obeyed. He uſed all meanes to appeaſe that uproare, but it availed not; for they obſtinate in fight attended not to any thing he ſaid.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible (he cried) that you will with your own blouds give the victory to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? What Anger, what hope, what reward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces you to be cruell againſt your friends? Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thoſe weapons with a more meritorious vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt thoſe who laugh at your furies. What Deity conſtraines you to ſacrifice your ſelves here to death? What barbariſmes? What fooliſhneſſes are theſe? What Fate wills it, that the beſieged ſhould enjoy their ſecurity by our perils? Shall then a ſimple indignation, ſprung by chance, doe more than an inveterate hatred of your enemies? You cannot be overcome but by your ſelves. Would you then that the Foe ſhould triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you long of your ſelves? Vent your rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who from the Walls looke for ſafety from our harmes.</p>
               <p>Theſe words nevertheleſſe prevailed not any thing in thoſe minds, which encruelized had not diſtinction to know their madneſſe. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and the voices of the wounded did not
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:169974:177"/>allay at all the fury of the Combatants, rendred incapable to obey, and to command. All thoſe Princes ruſhed into the Squadrons, by maine force routing them, not taking either example, nor moderation by the misfortune of thoſe that were falne before them. The <hi>Thracians</hi> many times endeavoured to draw out of the Rampiers, obeying more to the hand than to the voice of the King; but the Souldiers of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and the <hi>Scythian,</hi> with thoſe of the other Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them not. The <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Epirus,</hi> many times meeting, and many times parted by the great Croud, fell, upon one another afreſh. Perceiving that to uſe their ſwords was impoſſible, they cloſed, each ſtriving to caſt his enemy. They both fell, nor could they riſe againe, this being the laſt fall to them. The Preſſe was ſo great, that whoſoever fell was not in a ſtate to riſe, fining a Sepulchre many times before death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scythian,</hi> who ran formidable, carrying terrour by the moſt illuſtrious bloud, met with the Prince of <hi>Miſſia,</hi> who whereſoever he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed left alwaies ſignes of his valour. Both of them ſeeing they were ſo neare (every other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe being caſt aſide) turned againſt that which they moſt hated. That Tragedie had not preſented a Scene more funebrous. Before he ſtrooke, the <hi>Scythian</hi> ſaid: Now thou ſhalt pay for the contempt which with thy ſpeeches thou haſt given to my Councels and Affection. A Boy might well receive directions from a King that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:169974:178"/>loved him. I hope ſhortly to make you ſee that it had been better for you to have been born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tongue. Thou ſhalt not have friends, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the protection nor authority of the King which ſhall hide thee from the fury of this ſword. The Prince anſwered: In truth thou art come at this time to receive chaſtiſement for thy pride. I know thou deſireſt I were timerous and baſe, becauſe thy particular knowledge of thy own debility made thee feare one day the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedneſſe of this heart. They replied no more, becauſe with their ſwords they began to worke treaſon to their lives. The ſtrength of their Armours made many of their blowes fall in vain, although from many places they drew bloud. They were ſo ſtreightned by the multitude of Souldiers, that they could only ſtrike with their fiſts. This nevertheleſſe they did with ſuch a ſtrength and anger, that, their Armours being bruiſed, they were both deſperate of their lives. Throwing aſide their ſwords, they drew their knives, with which they left not any place of their Armours which they attempted not to kill by. The <hi>Scythian</hi> was more fierce, and the Prince more diſcreet, ſo that no advantage was known between them. Finally they reſolved to overcome or dye. The <hi>Scythian</hi> ſtrooke the Prince in the groine with cutting the buckles of his Armour, the blade entred into his bowels. He feeling himſelfe ſlaine ſtrooke the <hi>Scythian</hi> in the throat, between the joyning of the Breſtplate and the Helme. They both fell to the earth, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:169974:178"/>forth their ſoules, which without doubt will renew the fight, if hatred and anger are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed among the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorcone,</hi> ſeeing this Battell ſo obſtinate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by his utmoſt power to make his men draw out of the Rampiers. Laſtly, it ſucceeded, though he was divers times in danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Two houres only remained to the day, when with his head and his hand unarmed he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pacifie the Souldiery, who being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their perill, began in a great meaſure to calme their anger. But their miſeries were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled on them, when they were certified that Fire had taken poſſeſſion of their Fleet. Such a multitude of Galleys were on a ſudden come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that the <hi>Thracians</hi> not having time to weigh Anchor, or to retire into the Sea, were become a prey to fire, which in a mightie quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie was thrown upon them. Although the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was of many miles, thoſe terrours were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe heard, which declaring the burning rendred the dammage irreparable. Their feare was encreaſed upon them, when they underſtood that the enemies who had made the fire, in a grand number being landed, were marching thence to fall upon them.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> King of <hi>Create,</hi> who, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he had found her alive, without whom he could not live, had reſolved to returne into his Kingdome. Whileſt they were in their voyage, by asking after newes, they underſtood the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus</hi> made by the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:169974:179"/>
                  <hi>Thracians.</hi> That all the firme land of the Iſland being loſt, <hi>Arſinoe</hi> only held out beſieged by ſo many Armes, and ſo many Armies, that it could but a little longer reſiſt the force of ſo many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. That the <hi>Armeniuns,</hi> the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> with many other Princes, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves againſt King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> and to their detriment had raiſed Money and Souldiers. <hi>Dianea</hi> at theſe newes was not able to ſtop her teares that in abundance fell to vent forth the paſſion of her mind, caſting her ſelfe at the Kings feet, ſhe ſaid to him:</p>
               <p>I ſupplicate <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> over whom my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſumes to find ſome deſert. Sir, If I ſhould not love my Father I were unworthy to be yours, and in the ſame time to live. You your ſelf would but be a ſhadow of that heart that had not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for him who hath given me my being. If I had no other reaſon to love him, I have that of his begetting me to be yours. His having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me to death alters not my love. I rather glory to be daughter to a Father, who had rather puniſh his Child than derogate from Juſtice. That mind ſhould not be but celebrated which condemnes it ſelfe not to leave Crimes unpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. At this preſent, that he is expoſed to the invaſion of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to the power of the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> who boaſt to impoſe ſervitude upon <hi>Cyprus,</hi> I beſeech you, by that affection that intereſts you, to afford aide to my affaires, which at other times you haue not known how to refuſe to him. Permit not (O magnanimous) that theſe wicked
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:169974:179"/>ones ſhould vaunt to have the Father of her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to whom you have acknowledged your ſelf ſo many times a Priſoner. Beſides, how could you rejoyce in my embraces which would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſadded by my feares? I need not add that the Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> is mine after the death of my Father, becauſe where my entreaties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, it is not fit that Intereſt ſhould plead a Title. So much the rather, becauſe the greatneſs of your mind receives not an alteration from thoſe low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that reign only in vulgar boſomes. I know if <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſhould fall under the ſubjection of the <hi>Thracians, Creete</hi> would not be ſecure from the ambition of thoſe who would enlage the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of their Empire beyond the Confines of the World. But of this alſo I need not uſe a word to that heart which hath never been capable of feare, and which rejoyces that others conquer to make his own triumphs the more glorious. Let this only be an Adjunct to the immortality of your name, that you have twice delivered <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> from the barbariſmes of the <hi>Thrasians,</hi> and given twice life to a King when he the leaſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for it, and leaſt deſerved it. <hi>Dianea</hi> hath never entreated <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> without being heard. I aſſure my ſelfe the more in it, becauſe I ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for a Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> embraced her, ſaying to her: <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> I was unwilling to interrupt you, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoycing in your piety. The tenderneſſes ſhewed toward your Father, confirmes my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you know how to love. I glory that the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:169974:180"/>heavens have vouchſafed me the poſſeſſion of a mind which forgets not the Obligations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Not to have a memory for injuries is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to your generoſity. The wrongs a Father doth, ſhould not beget anger in thoſe that receive them. The earth at no time hath reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the Lightnings that <hi>Jove</hi> throws on it. I will go to the ſuccour of your Father, becauſe it is not convenient, that any beloved by you ſhould be in danger to be loſt. I know that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will carry felicity into that Kingdome which undergoes ſo many miſeries only by reaſon of your abſence. He ſpeedily commanded that their Voyage ſhould be directed towards <hi>Cyprus;</hi> Fame giving out that having obtained a Wife he went to get poſſeſſion of her dowry. To the Souldiers he promiſed the ſpoyles of the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> propoſing one other intervall to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but till he met with the enemy.</p>
               <p>Favoured by the Sea and the Winds, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the Fleet, which under the Command of the Count of <hi>Brandilia</hi> was diſperſed into the Ports without feare, and without defence. The <hi>Thracians</hi> beheld at one and the ſame time the Fire, Armes, and Death. The Count was buſie in play with all the other prime men that had Command in the Fleet in a Galley far diſtant from the reſt. Being informed of the fire, not willing to leave off play, he being a winner, commanded it ſhould be quenched, ſuppoſing it kindled by accident through the careleſsneſſe of the Galeyots, or Marriners. Being aſſured the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:169974:180"/>Navy was aſſaulted by enemies, now perſwaded the winds could not have ſuch force, he would not nevertheleſs ſtir, until the violence of the fire repreſented the inevitable danger to him. Then neceſſity rendring him a certainty of his neglect, he conſented not to retire or flye, much more fearing the diſpleaſure of the King than death. Perceiving the flames unextinguiſhable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence impoſſible, he commanded his Galleots they ſhould charge upon one of thoſe Galleys, whileſt he himſelfe reſolved to dye on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of ſome worthy perſon. There was not any there that would underſtand, or that would obey him. Feare had ſo daunted the minds of them all, that to avoid the fire they leapt out to ſwim, finding no defence but in deſperation. The ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was great, whileſt both Elements conſpired to the dammage of the <hi>Thracians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> victorious, without delay made his Souldiers go a Land; underſtanding by his Scouts the diſcord that was in the Campe in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army, heightning his courage, he ſaid to his:</p>
               <p>On O valorous! Let us purſue the Victory: Here is neither danger, nor labour in aſſaulting thoſe who are overcome by their own diſcords. Being at diviſion among themſelves, they will bring confuſion and terrour among themſelves. They were infinite in number, but there hath hapned ſuch a ſlaughter among them, that they will not any more have ſtrength to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The prime Chieftaines that rendred that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:169974:181"/>Army formidable are killed by their own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and the Gods would have made them all dye ſo, had they not been willing to have afforded ſome glory to your valour.</p>
               <p>On, on (O valorous) take to heart the teares of <hi>Dianea,</hi> my entreaties, and your own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Make a ſlaughter of theſe impious ones; kill them, for they would do the ſame to you if your virtue would permit them. To take a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner is to adde an impediment to you, and to ſave enemies. Spoiles will not be wanting to you. Theſe words being ended, which were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a felicious ſhout of all the Souldiers, he marched againſt the <hi>Thracians,</hi> who being got out of the Liſts, were put into that order which ſeare, danger, and the ſhortneſſe of the time would permit them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorcone,</hi> on the other ſide, inanimating, and exhorting his, ſaid: See to what termes your particular angers have reduced you. Now by a generall reſolution repaire that honour which in the opinion of men would be hardly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of by reaſon of your rage. Although the paſt misfortune hath ſwept away a great part of our Souldiers, we are nevertheleſſe yet the more in number. They would not have had the boldneſſe to have affronted us without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our own differences. They have been invited by us, having built their hopes uponour ruine. Perhaps you beleeve the <hi>Cretans</hi> will venture their lives for an old man repleat with ingratitude: That they will dye without hope
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:169974:181"/>of reward. They will hardly make triall of your force but they will ſupplicate us for pardon. If you have nor the heart to defend your ſelves, you will be neceſſitated to dye baſely. We are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by enemies; We muſt conquer or dye. Call to mind your victories, and that you are in the preſence of your King, who hath returned from all battels with honour.</p>
               <p>Theſe and other words the <hi>Thracian</hi> uſed to encourage them. The fight begun, the two Kings of <hi>Creete</hi> and <hi>Thracia</hi> defended their right Wings. The left of the <hi>Thracians</hi> was maintained by the Duke of <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> whileſt the oppoſite was commanded by the Count of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> of the bloud Royall, and who among the Chiefetaines of <hi>Creete</hi> held the firſt place. Both the Armies fell to it with ſuch an impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that the deſperation of the <hi>Thracians</hi> was very eaſily diſcerned, and the boldneſſe of the <hi>Cretenſians.</hi> Ire from it ſelfe preſented mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſpeeches. Every thing was ſlaughter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing demonſtrated death horribly. Dead bodies were ſeen in heaps, in mountaines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction either of their dignity or merit. The wounded fell upon the dead, and before they could dye, they had the horrour to ſee the deſtruction of a Parent, or a friend. Many unburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodies the living buried. Bloud fell in ſo great an abundance that the Souldiers could not keep their feet.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Cornia</hi> ſhewed proofes worthy truly of his valour, opening a way through the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:169974:182"/>thickeſt, with the genuine fierceneſſe of his heart. He encountred the Duke of <hi>Soitone.</hi> He turned upon him, willing to Nobilitate his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by the death of ſome remarkable Perſon. He ſtrook him with two redoubled blowes upon the Helme, while not being able to reſiſt ſuch a force, gave way to the Iron to enter, making almoſt his life to follow them. The Count called out to his to ſtrip him: but being treacherouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Flank by the Baron of <hi>Achialo,</hi> hee was enforced to fall, with ſuch a Reſentment of his, that they killed the Duke, not yeelding to take him Priſoner: for the which hee uſed all Importunity, promiſing Mountaines of gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> hearing of the death of the Count, became in ſuch wiſe encruellized, that neither Prayers nor Lamentations had power to move him to pitty. Shields and Helmets had no more reſiſtance againſt his ſword, then if they were of Glaſſe. Every ſtroke fell'd to the Earth, or kill'd. By his look and voice he drove the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers before him, who equally dreaded his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, and ſtrength: And for the moſt part, when his Sword fell upon them, they believed it a Thunder-bolt.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Dorcone</hi> ruſht into the Troops, routing them with ſuch a courage, that there was not any that fled not from his blowes. He ſtruck downe, wounded, flew, and with a deſperate reſolution, abandoned himſelfe into all dangers. <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> who to attaine to the Victory, knew the head of the <hi>Thracian</hi> was neceſſarie, call'd
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:169974:182"/>him by name in the thickeſt Croud of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Theſe words often, and often repeated, arrived to the Eares of <hi>Dorcone,</hi> who diſdaining himſelfe for being challenged the firſt, ran ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily thither, where <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> carried death, both in his Countenance and Sword. Before he would ſtrike him, he ſaid to him: Who art thou that haſt the boldneſſe to invite me to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate? <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> anſwered; I am he who am glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by the death of thy Brother. O yee Gods, replyed the <hi>Thracian,</hi> I render you thanks of paſſion, that I have ſuffered till now, ſince you have preſented me the occaſion to revenge that bloud which was ſhed by ſo much injuſtice. To thee (O beloved ſoule) I offer up this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, it thou diſdaineſt not a Sacrifice ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> replyed not, but with his Sword, giving the <hi>Thracian</hi> a blow that made him a little wound in his Flanke. On the other ſide, the <hi>Thracian</hi> ſtruck <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> on the arme, ſo that the bloud iſſued forth in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe Combated, Victory turned her back upon the <hi>Thracians,</hi> who by little and little drew back, retreating. All their Chiefe were either ſlaine or wounded. Whereupon, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any that ſhould awaken their Courages, they began to be diſordered, and to flie thence, whither they were tranſported by their feare; VVhich encreaſed much more upon them, when King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> not pardoning thoſe yeares which neceſſitated him to repoſe, marched out with
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:169974:183"/>the Count of <hi>Salinera,</hi> falling upon the backs of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> who being ſo intercepted, knew not whither to flye thence. The burning of the Fleet, and the cry of Souldiers, confuſed by the fragour of Armours, carried into <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> the ſtate of the Enemy, who nevertheleſſe took on them a Reſolution to iſſue out, not willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome without danger, neither without labour. Here the ſlaughter was more then great, becauſe the <hi>Thracians</hi> ſhut up into the midſt, knew not how to get off, becomming of Beſiegers, the Beſieged. They knew not what to do, but to cry for Quarter, and throwing downe their Armes to embrace the feet of the Conquerours. All the Standards were laid on the Earth, and the Companies no longer acknowledged their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. There was nothing elſe heard but indiſtinct Cries and pittifull of the overcome, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horridated the aire.</p>
               <p>Death and Feare had deprived the <hi>Thracians</hi> of all Reſiſtance, ſo that excepting <hi>Dorcone</hi> there was not any that made head, at the leaſt not to die cowardly. The <hi>Thracian</hi> perceiving himſelf encompaſſed by ſo many victorious ſouldiers, ſaid to <hi>Aſtidamo;</hi> You confeſſe your baſeneſſe, that you have not the boldneſſe to overcome me one to one. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> anſwered; Let us withdraw aſide: for I would that you your ſelf ſhould be judge of it. This ſaid, he commanded his, that they ſhould not offend him, receiving many times on his owne Shield, the ſtrokes of thoſe that ran ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to wound him. They went forth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:169974:183"/>retiring after many Compaſſes into a Valley, which encloſed round by ſome Hills, made ſhew as if it were ſo ſhut up for ſome Fight. Here then they ſtaid to renew the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
               <p>They began then afreſh to ſtrike with ſo much Anger, and ſo much Force, as if then onely they gave beginning to a Battail. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vaine all the blowes of his Adverſary, knowing him of great ſtrength. Now he fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, now he bowed, now with his Sword he put by the <hi>Thracians;</hi> whoſe Valour being in great meaſure decreaſed, by a continuall toile, his blowes were not but weak. Whereupon, <hi>Aſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damo,</hi> although wounded in many places, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the more his mind, and his courage more; Feigning he would ſtrike <hi>Dorcone</hi> on the face, he wounded him in the Hip, who growne furious at it, made in a moment a wound on <hi>Aſtidamo</hi>'s Head.</p>
               <p>They both loſt bloud, and leaving warding, and the rules of a Duell, they attempted not but to kill. How much the more the fight wanted of Art, it was ſo much the more perillous and mortall. The Furie in thoſe debilitated ſtrengths then began to languiſh, when <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Dorcone</hi> in his Breaſt, in that part the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to his Heart, plucking back his Sword all bathed in bloud. The <hi>Thracian</hi> fell, but with that heart that feared not death; helping himſelf with his left hand, hee ſtood to his Guard, reſting on a knee. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> admiring at the vertue of ſuch
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:169974:184"/>a man, ſaid, Yeeld (O Generous) ſince that Fortune wils that thou ſhalt be overcome. The <hi>Thracian</hi> abuſing that gentleneſs, which offered him the gift of his life, ſtuck his Sword into his Thigh, running it quite thorough. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> growne furious, and crying; Is this the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of my Mercy, thruſt his Blade into the ſight of his Helme, which could not reſiſt the force of an Arm, moved by a moſt juſt Anger. The <hi>Thracian</hi> dyed, when <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> not having ſtrength any longer to ſtan, fell likewiſe down, ready to dye, not leaving any diſtinction to know the Victor from the Conquered.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> in the meane while remaining with the <hi>Cretenſians</hi> maſter of the Field, gave leave to the Souldiers, that they might enrich themſelves with Plunder and Priſoners. This Victorie in ſuch wiſe rejoyced the minde of the Citizens, that there was not any of them, who enjoyed not part of the fruit of the Victorie. The weakeſt old men could not ſtay in the City, nor the infirmeſt Company of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Every one ran out to get ſome prey of the ſpoiles of the Enemy. The Priſoners were without number, and the booty was above value. So rich preyes, never <hi>Cyprus</hi> nor <hi>Creet</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> ſeeing the Crowne ſetled on his Head, and thoſe deſtroied that attempted on his Kingdome, and life; would be informed, if this ſuccour was dropt from Heaven. When he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that that Army belonged to <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:169974:184"/>King of <hi>Crete,</hi> hee was aſſaulted by grave thoughts. Peradventure, he had a feare equall to that he had had of the <hi>Thracians.</hi> He knew that Enmities with Kings were not appeaſed, but with bloud. He very well remembred, that he had forbidden him the Court with termes more then ſevere: And that by the condemnation of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> he had expreſſed ſignes of the hatred hee bore to the Kingdome of <hi>Crete,</hi> unwilling to endure her in life, who had preſumed to match her ſelfe with his Enemie. He feared theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours aimed not but to oppreſſe him; the Armies of Potentates not moving, but upon grand Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Nevertheleſſe, diſſembling thoſe Paſſions, which permitted him not to enjoy the joyes of the Victorie, leaving to the Count of <hi>Salinera</hi> the Command of his men, with ſome few of his, he went in queſt of <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> willing by a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Confidence and Affection, to maſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his diffidences, and his feares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> not being to be found in the field, he imagined he was retired to the Navy.</p>
               <p>He took his way thitherwards, but being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neare, he eſpied a Lady, who by her faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and motion, made a grand Pomp of her ſelf. Approaching nearer, and deſcrying the likeneſſes of <hi>Dianea,</hi> he cryed out: VVhat is this that is made an Object to my eyes? Are theſe Dreams or Phantaſms, that occupy my Cognoſcitive ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? This was <hi>Dianea,</hi> who hearing of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers coming to the Navy, was deſcended thence to meet him.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:169974:185"/>
               <p>Suddainly, as he drew neare her, proſtrating her ſelfe at his feet, ſhe ſaid to him; Father, I am that unhappy <hi>Dianea,</hi> who have demerited your affections. I have lived, not becauſe I have deſerved life, but becauſe Deſtiny hath been pleaſed to make me an Inſtrument for your ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Excuſe me (O Father) if by my preſence I am come to funerallize the joyes of your Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But in Conſolations, Favours, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are diſpenced: I ſupplicate you therefore, (moſt benigne Father) for pardon. Forgive by your favour the Errours of that heart that hath offended you, not to injure it ſelfe. It is true, I have loved the King of <hi>Creet,</hi> and I could not but love him, he having elected me for his Conſort. I conceived it a greater Crime to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him, then to afford him my affection. Who ever knowes <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> and loves him not, knowes not who deſerves Affection. Father, excuſe my tongue, that preſumes to run ſo much in the Applauſes of <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> for I know not how to honeſtize my Errour better, then by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the Prerogatives of him, who hath made me commit them. I ſhould plead ſomething in Excuſe of my fault, if I could repent me of it. I know not how to acknowledge a penitency for ſuch an Exceſſe, ſince from thence the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of your State, and the ſafety of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is derived. Behold, (O Father) at your benigne feet, <hi>Dianea,</hi> who untill now, through your diſpleaſure confeſſes her ſelfe unhappy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her at your feet, who though condemned by
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169974:185"/>you, hath not therefore refuſed to love you. Let my ſorrow to have provoked your indignation make amends for what I have treſpaſſed in. Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (mercifull Father) thoſe Affections to which Nature obliges you. Remember that you are a Father, and that only I can preſerve alive the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of your greatneſſe; ſuffer not (affectionate Father) that your Daughter <hi>Dianea</hi> ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and weep without being heard.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Vaſſileo,</hi> that hitherto remained oppreſt by a not known alteration, ſhedding ſo many teares, that one might even ſay, that the ſnow of his head thawing iſſued through his eyes, with a very great affection caſt his Arms about the neck of <hi>Dianea;</hi> ſaying to her: Oh! Of how many victories to day have the Gods been favourable to me! Beloved <hi>Dianea,</hi> lay aſide thoſe ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remembrances which perchance may render my preſence odious to you. Let Oblivion take poſſeſſion of all things paſt. I receive you for my daughter with a double conſolation, having ſo many times bemoaned you for dead. Beleeve me, I have received puniſhment for the ſentence fulminated againſt you, becauſe a Father is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the guiltineſſe of a Daughter. But where is <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> to whom we profeſſe our ſelves doubly engaged, both for your preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my life? To this purpoſe I came to the Navy. We are a ſevere Judge, but not an ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea</hi> replying the ſame ſollicitouſneſſe, not knowing what was become of <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> began
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:169974:186"/>to ſuſpect ſome ill. She uſed all diligence to have a certaine account. Many of the chiefe ſpred themſelves through the field to direct them the way, when they were turned aſide by the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their enemies. Others with lighted Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diſquieted the dead, with a feare to find him whom they ſought for. The night was much ſpent, when the report was that <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> was found dead not far off of the field. Feare carried the newes of it to the eares of <hi>Dianea,</hi> who, with an inquietude equall to the love ſhe bore him, gave command that the authors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſhould be found; ſhe heard too much of that ſhe would not from two Souldiers who had found him by chance, and were come thence to acquaint their Captaines with it.</p>
               <p>His death divulged, and the night aſſiſting theſe cruelties, rather amplifying into worſe all that Fame delivered, there was to be ſeen in the faces of all ſignes of ſadneſſe and diſpleaſue. The voices of the Souldiers were in ſuch wiſe heated, that, abandoning their Rankes, and not obeying their Officers, they knew not what elſe to do but with horrible exclamations to lament and ſigh. There neither Oſtentation nor Adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had place, for they felt a mightier paſſion in their ſoules than they could expreſs with tears. The Army now appeared a Deſert for ſilence, now an hell for the cries that were heard there. All the Souldiers in Armes with lighted Torches roared out the world was ruined, all their hopes were deſtroyed, with a behaviour ſo licentious,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:169974:186"/>that King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> was in ſome hazard of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dianea,</hi> after the manner of one diſtracted, ran crying, Where art thou O friend? Who hath had the preſumption to raviſh thee from me? You tutelar Gods of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> how have you a ſufferance at theſe injuries which this death hath adminiſtred? Is this the recompence he receives for his Labours, his Aſſiſtances, his Love? Moſt unjuſt heaven, ſince that evermore againſt him thou haſt produced maligne Influences. O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Fortune, what availes it me to have eſcaped from the anger of thy puniſhment, to have falne into the hands of him whom I adored, to have delivered my Father from his enemies, and my Country, to have obtained a pardon for the errours of my heart, to have twice beheld the deſtruction of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> if finally theſe joyfull remembrances ſerve to no other purpoſe but to infelicitate me!</p>
               <p>Unhappy <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> dead without the laſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements of <hi>Dianea.</hi> But how could he have been able to endure the preſence of her, who hath been the cauſe of his death? To ſave my Father, I have killed him. Then could not I gaine my Father without the loſſe of my Husband, nor enjoy my Spouſe without the loſſe of my Father. O rigours of Deſtiny! O inexorable neceſſities of Fate! Truſt your ſelves O mortals in the graces of that blind Goddeſſe that affords proſperities, to the end that with greater oppreſſion we may receive her diſcourteſies. I having freed my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:169974:187"/>ſeen the <hi>Thracians</hi> deſtroyed, and having attained to the Title of the Queen of <hi>Creete,</hi> and of Princeſs of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> beleeved I was not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inſtability of her inconſtancies. But theſe highneſſes have proved no other but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to precipitate me the more.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, ſhe arrived where <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> lay. Then, redoubling her teares and ſobs, it ſeemed that her heart would iſſue through her eyes, or that ſhe would altogether diſtill her ſelfe into teares. She ſaid ſometimes, when her lamentation allowed her an intervall:</p>
               <p>Unhappy <hi>Dianea,</hi> who could have preſaged to thee an object ſo infelicious? The feare of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which preſents to the Intellect, things which befall not under ſenſe, could not, no, not by the aſſiſtance of ſleep could not have preſented Scenes ſo unlucky. Who could have made my eyes beleeve thy preſence would have proved offenſive? O beloved, O delighted in, O deſired <hi>Aſtidamo!</hi> I ſhould number up thy beauties, and thy perfections raviſhed from me in that time wherein I chiefly hoped to enjoy them, but I will not render the <hi>Parcae</hi> more proud of ſo worthy a Rapine. Pardon me, if, having a mind to follow thee, I rob from thy memory the due Tribute of my teares. 'Tis true, I ought to love life only to bewaile thee, but I know the Recordancie of thy vertues have no need of Commiſerations; who knows not eternally how to lament <hi>Aſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damo,</hi> will weare the brand of the puniſhment not to have known him.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:169974:187"/>
               <p>With theſe and the like conceits <hi>Dianea</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned her ſelfe, not permitting that her words ſhould come forth but accompanied with teares and ſighs. That hot humour which bubled from her eyes, falling upon the face of <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> gave ſome ſpirit to him; whereupon opening his lips languiſhingly, he ſent forth a ſign. <hi>Dianea</hi> perceiving that meſſenger of life, uſing violence againſt her griefe that rendred her deſperate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tooke ſome part of comfort, began to ſay to him:</p>
               <p>Beloved <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> obſerve the Exequies which <hi>Dianea</hi> celebrates to thee with lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Friend, abandonate not <hi>Dianea,</hi> for <hi>Dianea</hi> will not forſake thee alive or dead. <hi>Aſtidamo</hi> opened his eyes, but was againe enforced to cloſe them, made heavy and troubled by wearineſſe, and the abundance of bloud he had loſt. The Chirurgions came, who found his wounds peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but not without hope of life. They only bound them up, applying Remedies and Lenitives to the ſword of the <hi>Thracian,</hi> to the aſtoniſhment of thoſe who knew not the ſecrets of Nature, and the power of Sympathy. Wounds are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with medicining the ſword of him that made them, without the paine of the patient, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the violences of thoſe remedies which render a thouſand times to the Infirme, death deſirable.</p>
               <p>He was brought into <hi>Arſinoe</hi> upon the armes of his. Being left to repoſe, the Phyſitians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould not be diſquieted for any accident whatſoever. <hi>Dianea</hi> notwithſtanding
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:169974:188"/>would waite at his bed all the remainder of the night. Ever and anon ſhe ſtole to the Curtaines, doubtfull of ſome new fainting, and fearing leſt Deſtiny againe ſhould raviſh him from her. He languiſhed between ſleeping and waking, and it was neare upon day, when he had not opened his eyes, neither had any knowledge where he was, nor of who attended on him. His voice was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and imperfect, ſo that his words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo ill compoſed, that they were hardly diſtinguiſhed by eares, the neareſt to him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he could diſcerne <hi>Dianea,</hi> who by maine force kept back her teares, he ſaid to her; Friend, do not doubt of my life: For I cannot dye having you neare me. Afterwards, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the deſtruction of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with little loſſe to his, and the diſcourſe of King <hi>Vaſſileo</hi> with <hi>Dianea,</hi> in a great meaſure he gathered ſtrength, and gave ſignes of recovery. The Chirurgions having found in the Armes all the beſt tokens, promiſed him ſound within the ſpace of a few daies.</p>
               <p>The people then, and the Souldiers, receiving a certainty of this, gave themſelves up to rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings. Some walked to the Temples to render thanks to the Gods. Others ſeeming mad for joy, ran up and downe the ſtreets. Divers ſtudied Epithalamiums, and Panegyricks. Many prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Banquets. All finally embracing their Friends, and rehearſing to others that which all knew, redoubled their Conſolations. Yet there was not any that equalled the mind of King <hi>Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſileo,</hi>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:169974:188"/>and of <hi>Dianea.</hi> The firſt time the King vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited <hi>Aſtidamo,</hi> he ſaid to him: Friend, The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you beare this houſe doth not allow me the occaſion to paſſe into the duty of an excuſe. Who knows how to oblige without hope of reward, can alſo ſuffer ill ſatisfactions without diſdaine. I make preparations for the Nuptials of <hi>Dianea,</hi> not to give you that which is yours, but that in the celerity you might take knowledge of my heart.</p>
               <p>So the Eſpouſals were haſtened on with that ſolemnity which is proper to ſo grand Princes. There was not a Pompe that could be equalized to this. The ſuperbiouſneſſe of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of <hi>Africa</hi> here demonſtrated the extreames of their power. In the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> the Ceremonies were celebrated. Afterwards atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by all the people, they returned to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, wearing away many daies in Banquets, and Turnaments. Their rejoycings were afterwards redoubled in the Child-bed of <hi>Dianea;</hi> ſhe was delivered of two Sons, who for valour and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty need not envy their Parents. <hi>Dianea,</hi> being accounted of as an heaven, would alſo emulate it in Twins. I remit the relation of their glories to the Genius of ſome pen more ſublime.</p>
